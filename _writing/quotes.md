“When you walk through the storm, hold your head high  
And don't be afraid of the dark!  
At the end of the storm is a golden sky  
And the sweet song of the lark.  
Walk on through the wind  
Walk on through the rain  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown  
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart  
And you'll never walk alone!”

--Douglas Adams

"Well, I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point, I'm afraid, where you begin to suspect that the entire multidimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs. And if it comes to a choice between spending yet another ten million years finding that out, and on the other hand just taking the money and running, then I for one could do with the exercise."  
--Douglas Adams

"and we’ll be saying a big hello to all intelligent life forms everywhere … and to everyone else out there, the secret is to bang the rocks together, guys."

"Vogon poetry is of course, the third worst in the universe. 
The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their poet master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning" four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging, and the president of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos was reported to have been "disappointed" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his 12-book epic entitled "My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles" when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save humanity, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain."  
--Douglas Adams

“Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The argument goes something like this: "I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"But," says Man, "The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED."  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"Oh, that was easy," says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.”  
--Douglas Adams

"I love deadlines. I love the wooshing sound they make as they go by."  
--Douglas Adams

"The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't."  
--Douglas Adams

"'You talked to it?' exclaimed Ford. 'What do you mean you talked to it?' 'Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its extermal computer feed. I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it,' said Marvin. 'And what happened?' pressed Ford. 'it commited suicide,' said Marvin, and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold."  
--Douglas Adams

--Douglas Adams

"'Listen, three eyes,' he said, 'don't you try to outweird me, I get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal.'"  
--Douglas Adams

"'Mr. Beeblebrox, sir,' said the insect in awed wonder, 'you're so weird you should be in movies.' 'Yeah,' said Zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink wing, 'and you, baby, should be in real life.'"  
--Douglas Adams

"'So, how are you?' he said aloud. 'Oh, fine,' said Marvin, 'if you happend to like being me, which personally I don't.'"  
--Douglas Adams

"'Hello,' said the elevator sweetly, 'I am to be your elevator for this trip to the floor of your choice. ...' 'Yeah,' said Zaphod, stepping into it, 'what else do you do besides talk?' 'I go up,' said the elevator, 'or down.' 'Good,' said Zaphod, 'we're going up.' 'Or down,' the elevator reminded him. 'Yeah, okay, up please.' There was a moment of silence. 'Down's very nice,' suggested the elevator hopefully. 'Oh yeah?' 'Super.' 'Good,' said Zaphod, 'now will you take us up?' 'May I ask you,' inquired the elevator in its sweetest, most reasonable voice, 'if you've considered all the possibilities that down might offer you?' Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall."  
--Douglas Adams

"Modern elevators are strange and complex entities. The ancient electric winch and "maximum-capacity-eight-persons" jobs bear as much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital."

"What about you, Colonel?  
My job isn't to believe or disbelieve. It's to act or not to act.  
...  
The other day, a young researcher asked me something.
He wondered if their power was the form the next stage of human evolution was taking, and perhaps that we'll all be able to control it some day.  
Scientists are a bunch of romantics. Military men always consider the risks first. It's taken thirty long years. We've come so far from the rubble. We can't just trade one for the other.  
I've always thought that you hated this city, Colonel.  
The passion to build has cooled and the joy of reconstruction forgotten, and now it's just a garbage heap made up of hedonistic fools.  
So you're trying to save the city, then?  
It's how a soldier thinks. A scientist wouldn't understand."  
--[Akira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(1988_film))

"Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact; it's an opinion. It's a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing."

--Lester Bangs, *Almost Famous*

"The word [*virtù*] derives from the Latin *virtus* which covers a range of meaning from moral uprightness to physical prowess, and its root in turn is *vir*, a man: to act with *virtù* is to display within the demands of a given situation those qualities of assertive energy which can transcend it, to display virility in fact. As its etymology indicates it is a strictly masculine concept--women appear in Machiavelli chiefly as tokens of male honour. In general, then *virtù* denotes those qualities of energy, courage, genius and resource which support self-determination; at its highest it gives purpose and direction to the drift of events and forces back the boundaries of chance."  
--Dominic Baker-Smith, introduction to *The Prince*, reminded me of "Be a man; do the right thing.", very yang rather than yin

"Machiavelli is invariably hostile to passivity, and what fortune has given she can with ease take away. ... This is why the prince who has relied least on fortune is actually better placed; not only has he been tested in his rise to power, but he is fully alert to the dangers which threaten his position."  
--Dominic Baker-Smith, introduction to *The Prince*

"[H]umble origin is a common trait of oustanding men, presenting a challenge which initiates their rise to power."  
--Dominic Baker-Smith, introduction to *The Prince*

"This is why gratuitous cruelty is condemned, not on moral grounds exactly but because it is self-defeating."  
--Dominic Baker-Smith, introduction to *The Prince*

"... the dialectic between fortune and talent ... *Fortuna* ... he seems to visualize her, along with her ally *Occasio*, in terms of traditional iconography: she is a woman and, as such, most responsive to those audacious enough to try and master her. ... Fortune may direct a half, or slightly more, of human endeavor, but an element of control is possible, and the opportunities she provides can be exploited by those with spirit. Even if she had such a major say in events, there is still a good deal left to the resources of *virtù*. The thing that is absolutely essential, as Machiavelli carefully emphasizes, is to remain alert and open to the changing circumstances of the times; so many who start out well fail through inflexibility. Adaptability is a necessary requirement for success"  
--Dominic Baker-Smith, introduction to *The Prince*

"I bought a house, bought a car, bought a pair of jeans  
bought a surfboard, bought a breakfast, bought beyond my means  
bought the items that you told me would enrich me,  
but it shits me: I feel exactly the same."  
--Ball Park Music, *Spark Up*

"[T]he reason why Trump was elected, and the reason why there is such incredible polarization in society right now, is because the top 10% of earners in the United States have been so focused on ensuring that they not only maintain but also extend their privilege. And for me the scandal that really summarized all of this was Varsity Blues and all of these very wealthy people that were doing everything possible to ensure that their kids--not deservant--found a way to get in to those best schools. And when I saw that Greenwich Connecticut, that *50%* of high schoolers taking the SAT out of Greenwich had, uh, letters from doctors that allowed them to take it with no time restrictions, unmonitored--that-that's not just rigged; I mean, that is *the* system. That's structural."  
-[Ian Bremmer, *Real Time with Bill Maher*, May 29th 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8a78lMXmAE&t=5m31s)

"You know what? Maybe nobody's the victim. Maybe we're just victimizing ourselves to avoid bettering ourselves. We keep looking for somebody to blame, but it's us. We're the monsters."

"The people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it."  
--Brene Brown

"Any book on happiness is likely to tell you to set clear goals on what you want to achieve and then work towards achieving them. The problem is it doesn't really work. You might become a millionaire by the time you're 40, but then you realize you haven't been able to sustain a happy relationship. Or when it doesn't work out you feel lost, and you blame yourself. When we live for our goals, we forget to live *now*. The philosopher Allen Watts made the point that when you listen to a piece of music, you don't just skip to the end because that's where it all comes together. You don't just read the last chapter of a book because that's the climax. Yet in life we're obsessed with endings. So you study for these exams so you can go to this university to get this job to work your way up to what? Eventually you reach some position in your 50s and you think "Is this it? Is this the thing? Is this what I've been working for?" And you forget that maybe life should be more like a piece of music, and you're supposed to be dancing."  
--Derren Brown

"We tend to dwell on our pasts and think that they somehow define who we are. But our pasts are just stories that we tell ourselves in the present...And we can be more skeptical of those stories if it helps us...We forget to apply the same natural skepticism to the most important stories we have, the ones we tell ourselves every day about who we are. And we can choose to change those stories."  
--Derren Brown

"This idea that those stories define us, in other words that it isn't really events that cause our problems but more our reactions to them, this all goes back to a Roman philosopher called Epictetus 2000 years ago. And Epictetus also gave us a great piece of advice, which I find helfpul every day. Epictetus said there are things in your life that you're in control of, and then there are things in your life that you're not in control of. So if you stop trying to control or change things that are not under your control anyway, you will of course remove a whole lot of pointless frustration and anxiety from your life. Right? He added to that: There are only two things that you are in control of: Your thoughts and your actions. That's it. So everything else, what other people do, what they think, what they think of you, how they behave, you can't control any of that anyway. So if you stop trying to, if you stop trying to fix it or change it in some way, if you just decide that anything on that side is fine and just let it go, nothing bad happens. You just feel better. You feel happier. You feel relief like you just put down a big heavy case of bricks."  
--Derren Brown

"...That is a miracle. And we can remember that when we tell ourselves we're a bit fat or our lives are a bit rubbish. This is the one life and the one body we have. We can tell ourselves a different story about it at least. We can be kinder to ourselves."  
--Derren Brown, *Miracle*

"I strongly believe that engaging with life is about understanding that it's the choices we make right now that are important, not the habits of our past."  
--Derren Brown

"Living life fully is not just about fulfilling ambition, regardless of what motivational books tell you. It's also about being kinder."  
--Derren Brown

"Courage is not the absence of fear; it's the mastery of it."  
--Derren Brown

"About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some won't like you at all."  
--Rita Mae Brown

"Good judgment comes from experience, and often experience comes from bad judgment."  
--Rita Mae Brown

"The problem today isn't that jobs are scarcer, or that positions in schools are fewer. It's that we live in a hypercompetitive order, where the competition is not just for arriving, but the competition is never-ending. Every human being is now requied to understand themselves as a little bit of human capital."  
--Wendy Brown, *Take Your Pills*

"There are many ways of breaking a heart. Stories were full of hearts broken by love, but what really broke a heart was taking away its dream--whatever that dream might be."  
--Pearl S. Buck

"Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned."

"This is the recipe. What they're going to do to these Nordic peoples is that they're going to turn them into reputable members of the international community....This is an age-old strategy that has worked on all sorts of peoples. I mean, to just name a few you could say thye Visigoths and the Ostrogoths and the Lombards and the Vandals and, yes, a couple of centuries before this time period, even the Franks themselves were in this same situation, and the Romans cooked them using the recipe into nice, civilized states. Now the term 'cooked' is the way the Chinese used to describe this process when they used to do almost the very same thing to the so-called barbarians on their borders....Certain things tend to work, and so you see them brought up again and again. And this idea of 'cooking the barbarians' next door is something you see over and over, and the recipe is different place to place. Like the Chinese version doesn't include Christianity. The version here in the European context does....In deffect, what the recipe is is destroying the culture of the peoples you're targeting and then replacing it with one more like your own. The reasons one can do this with a clear conscience is what makes this sort of a dual-use kind of strategy for a Frankish ruler or a Byzantine ruler. And by dual use I mean there's a wonderful way one can console onesself thinking one is doing a favor for the very people on the receiving end of this treatment. If you are a Christian ruler, for example, and you are bringing the Christian religion to a bunch of pagans and a bunch of heathens, you are doing them a great deed. This is a gift. You are helping them potentially get in to heaven. You are showing them the truth....You are showing them the error of their ways, and this makes you a better person for doing so. At the same time, this will create conditions on your border that are much more stable, controllable, answerable, and that will long-term eliminate your pirate problem....
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In this time period, Christianity shouldn't be thought of the way somebody might think of it today, like merely a spiritual change of focus....It is truly, let's call it a 'civilizational commitment'. And this is one of the big selling points, by the way. If you're trying to sell this to a potential Viking ruler, somebody you could back and get behind and say 'Hey, let me tell you why you should convert to Christianity and why your people should and what's in it for you.' I mean, it is essentially instant legitimacy for a ruler, instant legitimacy for his dynastic successors--so dynastic security--, instant infrastructure, and instant literacy. Just add Jesus. We're going to bring in educated people who write. They'll start chronicling hyour story, your history, the greatness of your people, your crop yields, all of that overnight. Right? Literacy will arrive. We'll start building things. We'll start teaching your people. The whole thing is state building in a very real sense of the word."

"Say what you want about America--land of the free, home of the brave--; we've got some dumb-ass motherfuckers floating around this country. Dumb-ass motherfuckers.

--George Carlin

"Google in the words auto-erotic asphyxia. Auto-erotic asphyxia. It's the practice of cutting off the oxygen to the brain at the last moment during masturbation in order to heighten the orgasm. And when I say common, 1000 kids a year die this way. Okay? 1000 of them die. So think how many of them are trying to pull this off, if you pardon the little pun that I throw in there. It's just to, just to lighten the mood. . . . So let's recap: Standing on a chair, rope around your neck, Peter in your hand. Now you have to time it just right so that just before you cum you almost die. And sometimes you miscalculate."

"Often when people discuss behavior change, when they talk about habits they want to shift, it’s usually centered around some kind of goal. They start with like 'Oh I want to lose 40lbs' or 'I'd like to double my income' or 'I want to reduce stress.' They have some kind of outcome that they want. And so the implicit assumption behind that is 'If I can just achieve this thing, then I'll be the kind of person I want to be. Then I'll have', you know, 'the life I wanna have.'...Most of your outcomes in life are a lagging measure of your habits. So for example your knowledge is a lagging measure of your reading and learning habits. Your bank account is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your physical fitness is a lagging measure of your eating and training habits. Even the clutter on your desk at work or in the garage or in your bedroom is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. And so if you get really motivated and set a big goal like 'I have the goal to clean my room', and then you spend a couple hours doing that, you have a clean room--for now. But if you don’t change the sloppy, messy habits that led to a dirty room in the first place, then you turn around two weeks later, and you’ve got a dirty room again. So we often think that the outputs are the things that need to change, but it's not really the results that need to change; it’s like 'Fix the inputs, and the outputs will fix themselves.'...Process over outcome."

"By the Closed Mode I mean the mode that we are in most of the time when we're at work. We have inside us a feel that there's lots to be done, and we have to get on with it if we're going to get through it all. It's an active, probably slightly anxious mode, although the anxiety can be exciting and pleasurable. It's a mode in which we're probably a little impatient, if only with ourselves. It has a little tension in it, not much humor. It's a mode in which we're very purposeful, and it's a mode in which we can get very stressed and even a bit manic, but not creative.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;By contrast the Open Mode is a relaxed, expansive, less purposeful mode, in which we're probably more contemplative, more inclined to humor, which always accompanies a wider perspective, and consequently more playful. It's a mood in which curiosity for its own sake can operate, because we're not under pressure to get a specific thing done quickly. We can play. And that is what allows our natural creativity to surface."

"In an age when politicians are judged first of all on personality, when the public assumes all of them to be deceitful, and when it’s easier and much more pleasurable to laugh about a political issue than to think about it, Johnson’s apparent self-deprecating honesty and lack of concern for his own dignity were bound to make him a hit."

"These days, every politician is a laughing-stock, and the laughter which occasionally used to illuminate the dark corners of the political world with dazzling, unexpected shafts of hilarity has become an unthinking reflex on our part, a tired Pavlovian reaction to situations that are too difficult or too depressing to think about clearly."

"We're asked to accept the world that God gives us and to accept it with love. If God is everywhere, and God is in everything, then the world as it is is all just an expression of God and his love, and you have to accept it with gratitude. Because what is the option? What is the option?"

And I guess I'm either a Catholic or a Buddhist when I say those things, 'cause I've heard those from both traditions. But I didn't learn it, that I was grateful for the thing I most wish hadn't happened; I realized it. And it's an oddly guilty feeling."  
"It doesn't mean you are happy this--"  
"I don't want it to have happened. I want it to not have happened. But, if you are grateful for your life, which I think is a positive thing to do--Not everybody is, and I'm not always, but it's the most positive thing to do.--, then you have to be grateful for all of it. You can't pick and choose what you're grateful for. And then, so what do you get from loss? You get awareness of other people's loss"  
"Well that's true, empathy."  
"which allows you to connect with that other person, which allows you to love more deeply and to understand what it's like to be a human being, if it's true that all humans suffer. And so, at a young age I suffered something so that by the time I was in serious relationships in my life, with friends, or with my wife, or with my children, I have some understanding that everybody is suffering and, however imperfectly, acknowledge their suffering to connect with them and to love in a deep way that not only accepts that all of us suffer but then also makes you grateful that you have suffered so that you can know that about other people. And that's what I mean. It's but the fullness of your humanity. What's the point of being here and being human if you can't be the most human you can be? I'm not saying best, 'cause you can be a bad person and a most human. I want to be the most human I can be. And that involves acknowledging and ultimately being grateful for the things that I wish didn't happen, because they gave me a gift."

"There are good and bad features of modern family life, in which relations are often based more on ties of affection than on duty or obedience. In these times, the people we choose to be close to represent not only a preference, but a profound statement of our identities. We are freed to surround ourselves with those who reflect our deepest values—parents included. We feel empowered to call on loved ones to be more sensitive to our needs, our emotions, and our aspirations. This freedom enables us to become untethered and protected from hurtful or abusive family members.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Yet in less grave scenarios our American love affair with the needs and rights of the individual conceals how much sorrow we create for those we leave behind. We may see cutting off family members as courageous rather than avoidant or selfish. We can convince ourselves that it’s better to go it alone than to do the work it takes to resolve conflict. Some problems may be irresolvable, but there are also relationships that don’t need to be lost forever.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is sometimes tempting to see family members as one more burden in an already demanding life. It can be hard to see their awkward attempts to care for us, the confounding nature of their struggles, and the history they carry stumbling into the present. It can be difficult to apologize to those we’ve hurt and hard to forgive those who have hurt us. But sometimes the benefits outweigh the costs. Tara Westover wrote in her memoir, *Educated*, 'I know only this: that when my mother told me she had not been the mother to me that she wished she’d been, she became that mother for the first time.'  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We are all flawed. We should have that at the forefront of our minds when deciding who to keep in or out of our lives—and how to respond to those who no longer want us in theirs."

"You're so young, way too young to be worried about not being smart enough. Until you're so old you start going senile, you have the opportunity to make yourself 'smarter'.

You feel like you are burnt out or that you are on the verge of burning out, but in reality you are on the verge of deciding whether or not you will burn out. It's scary to acknowledge that it's a decision because it puts the onus on you to to do something about it, but it's empowering because it means there is something you can do about it.

"When we put our butt on the cushion to meditate, in many of these traditions we invoke the intention that I'm going to sit and meditate not primarily for my own benefit, but for the benefit of others. That is, calming my mind and opening my heart is something that's not just good for myself, but even more importantly it's good for others. It's good for all of those with whom I interact."  
--Richie Davidson, Sam Harris #111

In meditation the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex literally exerts inhibitory control on the amygdala (emotional salience center of the brain for a whole range of emotions, positive and negative) and default mode network (associated with self narrative), which strengthens the connection there and allows us to better modulate responses over time, eventually leading to less reactive emotions and less modulatory input required.

"[S]tudents from elite schools expect success, and expect it now. They have, by definition, never experienced anything else, and their sense of self has been built around their ability to succeed. The idea of not being successful terrifies them, disorients them, defeats them. They’ve been driven their whole lives by a fear of failure—often, in the first instance, by their parents’ fear of failure. The first time I blew a test, I walked out of the room feeling like I no longer knew who I was. The second time, it was easier; I had started to learn that failure isn’t the end of the world.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But if you’re afraid to fail, you’re afraid to take risks, which begins to explain the final and most damning disadvantage of an elite education: that it is profoundly anti-intellectual. This will seem counterintuitive. Aren’t kids at elite schools the smartest ones around, at least in the narrow academic sense? Don’t they work harder than anyone else—indeed, harder than any previous generation? They are. They do. But being an intellectual is not the same as being smart. Being an intellectual means more than doing your homework.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If so few kids come to college understanding this, it is no wonder. They are products of a system that rarely asked them to think about something bigger than the next assignment. The system forgot to teach them, along the way to the prestige admissions and the lucrative jobs, that the most important achievements can’t be measured by a letter or a number or a name. It forgot that the true purpose of education is to make minds, not careers.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Being an intellectual means, first of all, being passionate about ideas—and not just for the duration of a semester, for the sake of pleasing the teacher, or for getting a good grade. A friend who teaches at the University of Connecticut once complained to me that his students don’t think for themselves. Well, I said, Yale students think for themselves, but only because they know we want them to. I’ve had many wonderful students at Yale and Columbia, bright, thoughtful, creative kids whom it’s been a pleasure to talk with and learn from. But most of them have seemed content to color within the lines that their education had marked out for them. Only a small minority have seen their education as part of a larger intellectual journey, have approached the work of the mind with a pilgrim soul. These few have tended to feel like freaks, not least because they get so little support from the university itself. Places like Yale, as one of them put it to me, are not conducive to searchers. [explorers]  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Places like Yale are simply not set up to help students ask the big questions. I don’t think there ever was a golden age of intellectualism in the American university, but in the 19th century students might at least have had a chance to hear such questions raised in chapel or in the literary societies and debating clubs that flourished on campus. Throughout much of the 20th century, with the growth of the humanistic ideal in American colleges, students might have encountered the big questions in the classrooms of professors possessed of a strong sense of pedagogic mission. Teachers like that still exist in this country, but the increasingly dire exigencies of academic professionalization have made them all but extinct at elite universities. Professors at top research institutions are valued exclusively for the quality of their scholarly work; time spent on teaching is time lost. If students want a conversion experience, they’re better off at a liberal arts college.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When elite universities boast that they teach their students how to think, they mean that they teach them the analytic and rhetorical skills necessary for success in law or medicine or science or business. But a humanistic education is supposed to mean something more than that, as universities still dimly feel. So when students get to college, they hear a couple of speeches telling them to ask the big questions, and when they graduate, they hear a couple more speeches telling them to ask the big questions. And in between, they spend four years taking courses that train them to ask the little questions—specialized courses, taught by specialized professors, aimed at specialized students. Although the notion of breadth is implicit in the very idea of a liberal arts education, the admissions process increasingly selects for kids who have already begun to think of themselves in specialized terms—the junior journalist, the budding astronomer, the language prodigy. We are slouching, even at elite schools, toward a glorified form of vocational training.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Indeed, that seems to be exactly what those schools want. There’s a reason elite schools speak of training leaders, not thinkers—holders of power, not its critics. An independent mind is independent of all allegiances, and elite schools, which get a large percentage of their budget from alumni giving, are strongly invested in fostering institutional loyalty. As another friend, a third-generation Yalie, says, the purpose of Yale College is to manufacture Yale alumni. Of course, for the system to work, those alumni need money. At Yale, the long-term drift of students away from majors in the humanities and basic sciences toward more practical ones like computer science and economics has been abetted by administrative indifference. The college career office has little to say to students not interested in law, medicine, or business, and elite universities are not going to do anything to discourage the large percentage of their graduates who take their degrees to Wall Street. In fact, they’re showing them the way. The liberal arts university is becoming the corporate university, its center of gravity shifting to technical fields where scholarly expertise can be parlayed into lucrative business opportunities.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It’s no wonder that the few students who are passionate about ideas find themselves feeling isolated and confused. I was talking with one of them last year about his interest in the German Romantic idea of bildung, the upbuilding of the soul. But, he said—he was a senior at the time—it’s hard to build your soul when everyone around you is trying to sell theirs.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Yet there is a dimension of the intellectual life that lies above the passion for ideas, though so thoroughly has our culture been sanitized of it that it is hardly surprising if it was beyond the reach of even my most alert students. Since the idea of the intellectual emerged in the 18th century, it has had, at its core, a commitment to social transformation. Being an intellectual means thinking your way toward a vision of the good society and then trying to realize that vision by speaking truth to power. It means going into spiritual exile. It means foreswearing your allegiance, in lonely freedom, to God, to country, and to Yale. It takes more than just intellect; it takes imagination and courage. “I am not afraid to make a mistake,” Stephen Dedalus says, “even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake, and perhaps as long as eternity, too.”  
...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The world that produced John Kerry and George Bush is indeed giving us our next generation of leaders. The kid who’s loading up on AP courses junior year or editing three campus publications while double-majoring, the kid whom everyone wants at their college or law school but no one wants in their classroom, the kid who doesn’t have a minute to breathe, let alone think, will soon be running a corporation or an institution or a government. She will have many achievements but little experience, great success but no vision. The disadvantage of an elite education is that it’s given us the elite we have, and the elite we’re going to have."  
--William Deresiewicz

"We have a crisis of leadership in America because our overwhelming power and wealth, earned under earlier generations of leaders, made us complacent, and for too long we have been training leaders who only know how to keep the routine going. Who can answer questions, but don’t know how to ask them. Who can fulfill goals, but don’t know how to set them. Who think about how to get things done, but not whether they’re worth doing in the first place. What we have now are the greatest technocrats the world has ever seen, people who have been trained to be incredibly good at one specific thing, but who have no interest in anything beyond their area of expertise. What we don’t have are leaders.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What we don’t have, in other words, are thinkers. People who can think for themselves. People who can formulate a new direction: for the country, for a corporation or a college, for the Army—a new way of doing things, a new way of looking at things. People, in other words, with *vision*.  
...  
[T]rue leadership means being able to think for yourself and act on your convictions.  
...  
*Thinking means concentrating on one thing long enough to develop an idea about it.* Not learning other people’s ideas, or memorizing a body of information, however much those may sometimes be useful. Developing your own ideas. In short, thinking for yourself....  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. It’s only by concentrating, sticking to the question, being patient, letting all the parts of my mind come into play, that I arrive at an original idea. By giving my brain a chance to make associations, draw connections, take me by surprise. And often even that idea doesn’t turn out to be very good. I need time to think about it, too, to make mistakes and recognize them, to make false starts and correct them, to outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and move on to the next thing.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I used to have students who bragged to me about how fast they wrote their papers. I would tell them that the great German novelist Thomas Mann said that a writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people. The best writers write much more slowly than everyone else, and the better they are, the slower they write. James Joyce wrote *Ulysses*, the greatest novel of the 20th century, at the rate of about a hundred words a day—half the length of the selection I read you earlier from *Heart of Darkness*—for seven years. T.S. Eliot, one of the greatest poets our country has ever produced, wrote about 150 pages of poetry over the course of his entire 25-year career. That’s half a page a month. So it is with any other form of thought. You do your best thinking by slowing down and concentrating.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;...Think about what the word [concentrating] means. It means gathering yourself together into a single point rather than letting yourself be dispersed everywhere into a cloud of electronic and social input. It seems to me that Facebook and Twitter and YouTube—and just so you don’t think this is a generational thing, TV and radio and magazines and even newspapers, too—are all ultimately just an elaborate excuse to run away from yourself. To avoid the difficult and troubling questions that being human throws in your way. Am I doing the right thing with my life? Do I believe the things I was taught as a child? What do the words I live by—words like *duty, honor, and country*—really mean? Am I happy?  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;...Unless you know who you are, how will you figure out what you want to do with the rest of your life? Unless you’re able to listen to yourself, to that quiet voice inside that tells you what you really care about, what you really believe in—indeed, how those things might be evolving under the pressure of your experiences....  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;...The very rigor and regimentation to which you are quite properly subject here [at West Point] naturally has a tendency to make you lose touch with the passion that brought you here in the first place. I saw exactly the same kind of thing at Yale. It’s not that my students were robots. Quite the reverse. They were intensely idealistic, but the overwhelming weight of their practical responsibilities, all of those hoops they had to jump through, often made them lose sight of what those ideals were. Why they were doing it all in the first place.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So it’s perfectly natural to have doubts, or questions, or even just difficulties. The question is, what do you do with them? Do you suppress them, do you distract yourself from them, do you pretend they don’t exist? Or do you confront them directly, honestly, courageously? If you decide to do so, you will find that the answers to these dilemmas are not to be found on Twitter or Comedy Central or even in The New York Times. They can only be found within—without distractions, without peer pressure, in solitude.  
...  
'She had given me a chance to come out a bit—to find out what I could do. No, I don’t like work. I had rather laze about and think of all the fine things that can be done. I don’t like work—no man does—but I like what is in the work,—the chance to find yourself. Your own reality—for yourself, not for others—what no other man can ever know.' [--Joseph Conrad, *Heart of Darkness*]  
...  
Thinking for yourself means finding yourself, finding your own reality. Here’s the other problem with Facebook and Twitter and even The New York Times. When you expose yourself to those things, especially in the constant way that people do now—older people as well as younger people—you are continuously bombarding yourself with a stream of other people’s thoughts. You are marinating yourself in the conventional wisdom. In other people’s reality: for others, not for yourself. You are creating a cacophony in which it is impossible to hear your own voice, whether it’s yourself you’re thinking about or anything else...Leadership means finding a new direction, not simply putting yourself at the front of the herd that’s heading toward the cliff.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So why is reading books any better than reading tweets or wall posts? Well, sometimes it isn’t. Sometimes, you need to put down your book, if only to think about what you’re reading, what you think about what you’re reading. But a book has two advantages over a tweet. First, the person who wrote it thought about it a lot more carefully. The book is the result of his solitude, his attempt to think for himself.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Second, most books are old. This is not a disadvantage: this is precisely what makes them valuable. They stand against the conventional wisdom of today simply because they’re not from today. Even if they merely reflect the conventional wisdom of their own day, they say something different from what you hear all the time. But the great books, the ones you find on a syllabus, the ones people have continued to read, don’t reflect the conventional wisdom of their day. They say things that have the permanent power to disrupt our habits of thought. They were revolutionary in their own time, and they are still revolutionary today.  
...  
Introspection means talking to yourself, and one of the best ways of talking to yourself is by talking to another person. One other person you can trust, one other person to whom you can unfold your soul.
This is what we call thinking out loud, discovering what you believe in the course of articulating it.

"So there was a kid back in February from, ah, Baltimore--ah, 14 years old [Jack Andraka]--who, ah, had access to Jstor. And he'd been spelunking through Jstor after reading something, and he figured out a way to do early tests for pancreatic cancer [by infusing a conductive carbon mesh with a chemical that bonds to a biomarker from blood of a testee, thereby changing the conductivity of the material]. And pancreatic cancer kills the shit out of you because we detect it way too late: By the time we detect it, it's already too late to do anything about it. Ah, and, um, He sent emails off to the entire oncology department at Johns Hopkins, you know, hundreds of them .. and most of them ignored it, right. But one of them, like, sent him an email back and said 'This is not an entirely stupid idea. Why don't you come on over.' And this kid worked evenings and weekends with this researcher, and in February I heard him on the news, just a couple of weeks after Aaron died, when Aaron was in the news a lot. [*pauses and tears up*] Sorry [*breathes*] And, ah, he said, um, the reason he was on the news is cause they'd done it; they were shipping, ah, an early test for pancreatic cancer that was gonna save lives. And he said, ah, this is why what Aaron did was so important: Because you never know, right? This truth of the universe is not only something [*wipes tear*] that policy makers use to figure out, you know, what the speed limit should be; it's where the, the thing that's gonna keep, you know, your kid from dying of pancreatic cancer comes from. And, without access, the person who might come up with the thing that's got your number on it may never find that answer."

"Woe to him who saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point in carrying on. He was soon lost. The typical reply with which such a man rejected all encouraging arguments was, 'I have nothing to expect from life any more.' What sort of answer can one give to that?

We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that *it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.* We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life--daily and hourly.

"When Reframing is complete, the Problem is not 'solved'--it doesn't even exist any more. There is no longer any Problem to discuss, let alone a Solution [(which may cause its own consequences and problems)]. [Or, the Problem can be transformed to something more tractable.] In the fleeting moment of transition from the old Model to the New [(Paradigm Shift)], one has a brief opportunity to realize consciously what most of us seldom think about, namely, that labels such as ['crime', 'oppressor', 'socialism', etc.] are *artefacts of terminology*, not permanent attributes of the Universe or of Human Nature.

"...the necessity of a New Breed of Systems-student--one who, having absorbed the Axioms here collected and, more importantly, the *spirit* infusing them, can progress beyond technology to the kind of wisdom the world needs. The world already suffers from too many experts. They tell us more than we need to know or dare to ask about ingenious machines, fusion bombs, and management science.

For such questions your run-of-the-mill expert is of little value. What is required is a special, elusive talent, really an intuition--a feel for the wild, weird, wonderful, and paradoxical ways of Large Systems.

"Systems are seductive. They promise to do a hard job faster, better, and more easily than you could do it yourself. But if you set up a System, you are likely to find your time and effort now being consumed in the care and feeding of the System itself. New Problems are created by its very presence (Fundamental Theorem). Once set up, it won't Go Away; it Grows and Encroaches (Laws of Growth). It begins to do Strange and Wonderful Things (Generalized Uncertainty Principle) and Breaks Down in Ways You Never Thought Possible (Fundamental Failure Theorem). It Kicks Back, Gets In The Way and Opposes Its Own Proper Function (Le Chatelier's Principle). Your own perspective becomes distorted by being In The System (Functionary's Fault). You become anxious and Push On It To Make It Work (Administrator's Anxiety). Eventually you come to believe that the misbegotten product it so grudgingly delivers is What You Really Wanted all the time (Systems-delusion). At that point, Encroachment has become complete. You have become absorbed. You are now a Systems-person."  
--John Gall

"Go with the flow. In human terms, this means working *with* human tendencies rather than against them. For example, a State-run lottery flourishes even in times of economic depression because its function is aligned with the basic human instinct to gamble a small stake in hopes of a large reward. The Public School System, on the other hand, although founded with the highest and most altruistic goals in mind, remains in a state of chronic failure because it violates the principle of spontaneity in human learning. It goes against the grain and therefore it does not ever really succeed. It has made literacy universal, but not truly popular."

"[O]ne of the defining characteristics of true transformation is self redefinition. ... Indeed, rather than be swept away by life and force of habit, the individual can seize control of their life. They can fight against 'inevitability' and the idea of settling for whatever life hands them. We are either compliant with our seemingly preordained fate or we fight. We who choose to embrace the fight understand that life itself is a struggle and \[welcome\] it. Compliant living is mere existing.

"Common sense tells us that consciously thinking about a problem or deliberating about the options is the best strategy for making a decision. Consider the possibility that *not* consciously thinking can produce an outcome superior to that of consciously thinking. In a study be Ap Dijksterhuis (2004), participants evaluated complex information regarding real-world choices. One situation involved selecting an apartment. In each case, the participants chose between alternatives that had negative features (e.g., high rent, bad location) and positive features (e.g., nice landlord, good view). Objectively, one apartment was the best choice. Some participants were required to make an immediate choice (no thought). Some had to think for 3 minutes and then choose (conscious thought). Others had to work for 3 minues on a difficult, distracting task and then choose (unconscious thought). Across three separate trials, those in the unconscious thought condition made the best decisions. According to Dijksterhuis and Nordgren (2006), unconscious processing is especially valuable for complex decisions in which it is difficult to weigh the pros and cons consciously. Perhaps this is why, for very important decisions, people often choose to "sleep on it.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Consider also the possibility that consciously thinking can undermine good decision making. The social psychologist Tim Wilson and the cognitive psychologist Jonathan Schooler (1991) asked research participants to rate james. When the participants simply tasted the james, their ratings were very similar to experts' ratings. However, whent he participants had to explain their ratings jam by jam, their ratings differed substantially from the experts'. Unless the experts were wrong, the participants had made poorer judgements: Having to reflect consciously about their reasons apparently altered their perceptions of the jams."

"I think the simplest and most pragmatic way of understanding it [enlightenment] ... the most down-to-earth way of understanding it, rather than as some great mystical experience, is 'the mind free, free of those patterns and tendencies that cause suffering', like, in traditional Buddhism, of greed and hatred and delusion [the "defilements", the opposite of wisdom]. So we could say enlightenment is the mind free of those forces. Now this can be interpreted in two ways ... : It can be be interpreted in terms of: These forces are actually uprooted so that they don't arise again. And this is a very classical view of the path of enlightenment, that they're progressively weakened and finally uprooted from the mindstream. Another way of viewing it, which many teachers and traditions do, is not so much with the understanding that they're uprooted, but rather in the moment of their arising they're seen through, so we're not caught by them in any way. In both cases the mind is free. I have a slight bias toward one of these views [laughing], but I take a somewhat agnostic position in terms of the ultimate truth of one over the other."

Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place ... Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you.

Seize that moment. That moment is a crossroads where everything you want will collide with everything standing in your way. You've got momentum at your back.

"This ability to begin again has ethical force as well. It's actually the foundation of forgiveness. The only way to truly forgive another person--or one's self--is to restart the clock in the present. And this habit of mind allows for a resilience that we can't otherwise find. ... There's no real reason why the next 10 minutes in the gym can't be the best you've had in years. There's no real reason why you can't put this conversation, that's almost over, on a new footing by saying something that is truly useful. So the practice is to stop telling ourselves a story about what has been happening and fully connect with experience in this moment."  
--Sam Harris

"What begins to happen is that your own psychological suffering becomes a kind of mindfulness alarm, which reminds you to pay attention. And when you pay attention, it actually helps. That's the sign that your mindfulness is becoming a useful skill. And in those moments, you no longer imagine that your suffering is coming from the outside. You're no longer disposed to merely blame the world or other people. You realize, viscerally, that that thing that made you angry or anxious wasn't the true cause of your suffering. The true cause was internal to your mind. And you can take responsibility for noticing this process and for relaxing the apparent hold it has on you."  
--Sam Harris

"When you look at the things psychologically that cause you to be a dick, that cause you to act out, that cause you to, let's say, if you feel angry, to helplessly express your anger in relationship, no matter how inappropriate. What that is is a fundamental lack of mindfulness. In the worst case you're not even aware of becoming angry until the words fly out of your mouth, and there's no possibility of being otherwise. You see no choice. There's no pause to take because this thing broke over you like a wave, and everything got wet. ... [This] gives you two categories of experience: You can be angry and totally lost in it, or you can be aware of anger as kind of an energy state of your body, or an arising emotion, which you then can either act out or be motivated to act by, or you can observe as just a change in your person. And the observing mode is different and leads to different consequences. It leads you to pause before saying something. But as you get better and better at that, what you begin to notice is that all of these negative emotions have a very short half-life. It's impossible to actually stay angry for any significant amount of time, much less be motivated to derange your life or relationships on its basis, without continually being lost in thought about why you should be angry, or why you have every right to be angry. You have to stay lost in thought. You literally have to be thinking without knowing that you're thinking. ... Is it worth being angry here? Is there some ethical purpose served by expressing anger? Or is this just needless?"  
--Sam Harris, appearance with Andrew Huberman

"What remains emotionally and attitudinally when you're no longer taken in by thought to the usual degree, and more and more as you break that spell more and more, seems to be exactly the prosocial emotions you would want in a wise and enlightened person. It's not like you become totally without affect, totally without connection to other people. And you can sort of understand why this would be the case, because the inward-turning construction of self, the self-absorption, the concern about what others think about us, the endless judging of people, the continuous capture with our own opinion-making and rumination--when you look at what that's doing to you ethically and emotionally and in relationship, it's a kind of running failure of relationship. It's a failure to actually have sufficient free attention to merely pay attention to others and to actually recognize that you love them, that you care about them, that you want them to be happy. ... When you're speaking to another person, and you're having a face-to-face conversation, so they're looking in to your eyes, and you're looking in to theirs, what prevents that from being...something like the beatific vision? ... Your neurotic concern about how you're perceived, your judgement of them, all of this is mediated by thought of one form or another, and there's a kind of collapse of attention, where you're behind your face, looking at the other and feeling looked at. You become an object in the world for others, and there's that Sartre-ian moment where he decribes this transition-- ... He talked about the condition of a voyeur looking at the object of his lust from outside her window, and the primal circumstance is for that mere subject looking at another to suddenly hear someone stepping up behind him. In that moment, the collapse of recognition that you are an object in the world for others, that contraction--it is a contraction. It is a kind of knot that gets magically tied, seemingly in the center of experience, and so much of our seeking to feel better in life is an attempt to relax that knot. And our peak experiences, when we have them, sexually, athletically, aesthetically, the moments when we get out of ourselves, when there's no distance between ourselves and experience, or ourselves and another person, it's a moment where suddenly we seem to no longer feel that cramp of separateness. ... So what remains when you can actually break this spell is not this cold detachment, necessarily. The mind becomes a kind of wellspring of compassion and freedom from inwardness. Like when you're looking at a sunset, not only can you really look at it without any kind of splitting of your attention; there's *only* the sunset. You're so fully looking at it that you're no longer telling yourself the story of how beautiful the sunset is. [\[Psychological\] fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy) is the wrong concept [for this], because it's just a non-separation. You're no longer breaking yourself off and <a class="page-scroll" href="#Mezinger">constructing yourself in opposition to the world.</a> And so it is with other people: You can recognize that when you give your full attention to the other person, and none of your energy is being spent in being concerned about how they perceive you, it's just a much deeper experience of connection."  
--Sam Harris, #295

"If you are suffering, you are lost in thought. And until you learn a practice like mindfulness, there is no alternative. You live at the whim of the next sentence or image that appears in your mind. ... So when you're suffering, just notice the present thought. Where is it? What is it? What happens to it when you pay attention? And how is it that your suffering can continue in the next moment when the present thought has disappeared?"  
--Sam Harris

"The fact that a thought has arisen does not give it a necessary claim upon your life. It need not have any implications."

"Without having had certain experiences, you really have no sense of how limited your normal experience is. This is in terms of affect and cognition and the ethical implications of both. You just don't know how confined the prison of your mind is, or even that it is a prison, until one of the walls has been broken down for you, and you've seen some vast horizon that you didn't even imagine existed--or even if you did, even if you paid lip service to the possibility, you just didn't know what it would be like to confront it."

"Clearly the burden is on us to figure out how to spread the wealth around and to reconcieve of what it means to be a productive member of society and how people get the self esteem needs and the belonging needs and the connection needs met in a context of those new norms, where when someone says 'Oh, what are you doing with your life?' Now the self esteem module in the average Ivy League brain, it returns the string 'Oh, I'm a junior at Harvard.', and that's answer enough. That's the perfect answer. And then a few years later it will be 'I just got a job at Goldman Sachs.' or Google, and that's the perfect answer. But at a certain point that answer isn't enough, and people can realize it isn't enough even now when they take an inventory of their moment-to-moment experience."

Harris: "[A]t every moment in your life you are practicing something; you're using your atttention in a certain way. And for the most part, if you're like most people, you're using it in ways that lead to predictable sorts of dissatisfaction. You're practicing a kind of meditation on all the things you want, all the things that make you anxious, and a kind of perpetual distraction for which a method like mindfulness is put forward as an antidote. But, as your mind is your life becomes, and so you're engraining various tendencies and habits and neurophysiological states moment by moment, every moment of your life."  
Davidson: "One of the things I frequently say is that neuroplasticity occurs wittingly or unwittingly; most of the time it's occurring unwittingly. Most of the time we're being shaped by forces around us about which we have little insight and little control. And the invitation in this work is that we can actually more intentionally take responsibility for our own minds and brains by cultivating healthier habits of mind."  
Goleman: "...things are changing in a direction I think people may feel a little helpless about. But meditation, or cultivating the ability to concentrate and ignore distractions, I think has a special cachet and virtue now that wasn't true in the past, if only as an antidote to a social trend. There was research at Harvard, that famous paper in Science where they monitored how distracted people are during the day, and the title was 'A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind', because the more your mind wanders in distraction, the more depressed you get."  
Harris: "There really is a different conception of mental health here that we are tacitly endorsing [strength?] ... Most people don't even know that their minds are continuously lost in thought ... Then when you enter a contemplative tradition, and in particular a discussion of mental training in the Buddhist tradition, you see, really as almost your first claim, that this is absolutely pathological, to have your attention continually buffeted by the winds of discursive thought, and you're helplessly carried away by every single thought that enters consciousness. And not only are you carried away by the emotions that it invokes--desire and fear and boredom and all the rest--, you are identified with it such that it seems to be you. Your sense of self is bound up in the flow of thought in a way that most people, it's never occurred to them to question. ..."  
Davidson: "... attentional distraction, mind wandering, as well as reification of the self, believing the thoughts that we have about ourselves as a true depiction of reality, considering them to be true--That you see in depressed people, for example. One of the characteristics of depression is that negative self-thoughts are actually taken to be a veridical description of who the individual is. ... This whole idea we call experiential fusion, where you have the experience of being completely fused with the thought, rather than having a quality of meta-awareness, which is knowing that there is actually a thought occurring and being able to see it as a thought.--And that's something that of course we know can be taught through the kinds of contemplative practices that we're considering.--And one of the most important findings really is the finding that meta-awareness can be strengthened...recognizing that a thought is a thought rather than being swept up in its content."  
Goleman: "One of the main principles of cognitive therapy is that you don't have to believe your thoughts. That's a very revolutionary idea for most of us."

This had a lot to do with the fact that I did not have a clue what I was doing, of course, but there is a real issue here: JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it allows.

So for, you know, bears and chimpanzees and raccoons and birds and fish. How many kilocalories per kilometer did they spend to move? And, and humans were measured too. And, ah, the condor won; it was the most efficient. And mankind, the crown of creation, came in with a rather unimpressive showing about a third of the way down the list. Um, but somebody there had the brilliance to test a human riding a bicycle. *smiles* Blew away the condor--all the way off the charts! And I remember this really had an impact on me. I really remember this: that humans are tool-builders, and we build tools that can dramatically amplify our innate human abilities. And to me [the computer represents the ultimate tool.]--We actually ran an ad like this very early at Apple, that the personal computer was the bicycle of the mind. And I believe that with every bone in my body, that of all the inventions of humans the computer is going to rank near if not at the top as history unfolds and we look back."

"In the biggest picture, aside from psychadelics' ability to treat one disorder or another, I think they're just poised to really help us to understand the nature of psychiatric disorders. What commonalities do they have with each other that are somehow being addressed by psychadelic treatment? I kind of think of all of these disorders as different forms of addiction. So whether it's to a substance like tobacco, or alcohol, cocaine, or a way of thinking about yourself, it's this narrowed mental and behavioral repertoire. Reality used to be like this [arms wide], and now your reality is like this [narrows hands together]. And psychadelics, when done well in the right setting, have the ability to just blow people out of that narrowed story."

"It must have been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were required to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6 p.m. curfew. I had gone to play with a Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others, the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting."

"There are actually different types of self-actualizing people. There are self-actualizers who are perfectly content going their entire lives realizing their own potential...but they really don't care much about maximizing the potential of others. There's not a great connection between self and others. They may dazzle with their talents, or at work they may be doing good work, and they feel self-actualized. But they're not what Maslow called the transcenders. He argued that transcenders were a different kind of self-actualizers who were consistently motivated by higher values. He called them the 'be values', the values of being itself, things where there's no means to an end; they're ends in themselves, like the search for beauty, the search for justice, for meaningfulness in the world, for goodness. And you're motivated by these values, but also you're motivated by peak experiences in life."  
Harris: "...there's more needed in the toolkit for living a truly examined life and becoming a better person than just having certain self-transcending experiences. Certainly I think the 'peak experience' is the wrong model. Whatever the peak is, it comes; it goes; it's not the ultimate insight in to the nature of your consciousness that will transform you. ... What's needed is an actual conscious integration with ethics."  
"...I think it's really important to not treat these practices as panaceas, as quick fixes. Maslow called them 'quick hits of transcendence'; he was very much against that. He thought self-actualization took a lot of work. ... He really viewed self-actualization as being committed to a calling or something deep within yourself that you love that brings out the best in you, and that you are committed to working towards day in and day out. He very much was in that sort of meaning mode, similar to Viktor Frankl."

"You can live your life with a fear of uncertainty: In a sort of linear way, the greater the fear, the more we go in to this state psychologists have identified, psychological entropy, where we, at the ultimate extreme, we just can't cope, and we get depression; we feel helpless. Or you can live in a constant state of exploration. And exploration means that you are actively exploring the unknown. The unknown excites you. The unknown entices you. The more you can master and challenge the unknown, the happier you are in your life. ... You have to constantly choose the exploration option and learn how to manage the uncertainty that's inevitable in your life. ... Are you really going to live that life with a spirit of exploration and openness to new experiences and curiosity for the unknown, or are you committed to fearing it and having that illusion of control?"

"I teach a course at Columbia called The Science of Living Well ... Most of these students have been living on autopilot thinking 'Oh, the piont is to get a good GPA so that I have a good resume to get in to a good--' It's always about the future. It's always about some objective metric that everyone can agree on as 'Now you're worth it. Now you're worthy.' In this course I teach I have growth as the metric, and that's it. So there isn't comparison from one person to another. I have a whole series of growth challenges throughout the semester. Maybe it could be confronting and embracing your dark side and really becoming friends with it. Another growth challenge is increasing the high quality connections in your life, or being more mindful of things around you and having more gratitude in your life. And you start to add up all these things, and students start to realize that _that's_ life, like those are the things. There's actually nothing more to life. That's it!  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;... Really, the plateau experience, that's the most profound, transcendent moments of your life, where you can find the miraculous in the everyday. _That's_ life. If you can cultivate that skill, that'll be a far greater skill than constantly beating yourself up over not getting this grade or that grade or this amount of money, or look that other person's getting that amount of money. Life becomes a zero-sum relative game. If you can move towards growth in your momentary experiences in your life and really realize that everything around you is alreay pretty miraculous, like right now, that's a fundamentally different way of being and living.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;... The insight a lot of these students are getting is that: You may think that there ever will be a point in uyour life where you get there, and then you've accomplished something, or you've reached self-actualization, or you've reached transcendence. But it's _all_ just a process. It's _all_ just the relational interaction between the experience of you and the world. And that happens in a momentary, momentary basis. And there are just so many things we can do right now without waiting, without waiting for that paycheck or waiting for the next job that can give us meaning."

"I think to realize that you were not only so wrong but so wrong in such a harmful way is a devestating thing to realize, and it's something that it's totally human to want to rebel against at every point. The sunk cost isn't just that they were wrong and that's embarrassing. The sunk cost is that they hurt someone in the process of being wrong. And so it's not just the misinformation, and it's not just the ego of wanting to be right: I think that people are afraid of what it means about them if they were this wrong, and that it's much easier for them to believe that there's something wrong with me to have deserved the harm that I suffered. And so, I think it goes to people identifying with their ideas, and, when put on the spot and even when having plain evidence put in front of them that what they believe is wrong, it feels to them like what you're saying is that they're a bad person. And that's why they can't grasp just the plain, hard, cold facts of it, because it's charged with emotional resonance and with a sense of it implicating them and their identity and who they imagine themselves to be as people."

"High, wild places are the closest thing I have to a church. They’ve nurtured my soul for more than 60 years. They’ve restored my emotional equilibrium during periods of despair. They are where I feel most at peace....There is no getting around the fact that steep terrain is inherently dangerous, however. And for those of us who spend as much time as possible on the heights, our dirty little secret is the hazards are actually part of the appeal. The danger sharpens the senses, rids the mind of trivialities, compels one to focus exclusively on the moment. Stepping out of your comfort zone and confronting your fears can be transformative. ...

We separate everything that we can see or experience in to tiny little squares that we can label. And that helps us make predictions and communicate about what's going on and so on. Uh, but the reality isn't like that; the world isn't made up of separate things. It's all just a big mass of gloop. And even if you look at it scientifically, it's very hard to make the distinction between, uh, separate people and objects. As a person I am constantly interacting [with] and part of my environment, both through sight and hearing and breathing and eating and--And at what point does that air or that food, uh, become part of me? And at what point is it part of the environment? And I guess my point here is that by thinking about this we can learn something deeper about our interaction with the world around us.

We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control a) how we interpret what happens to us, and b) how we respond to what happens to us. Therefore, whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences."

"I liked economics in that, like, I liked..math. Um, I didn't understand that its real-world application, banking, was something very different. You know?...And I was like 'Oh, this is so different from', um, 'how I imagined it when I was in college', you know late at night in the library, like struggling with some proof and being like 'Ahhh! Okay, I'm gonna get my brain to figure this out.' That part of it I loved, but then when I was at a bank, and they're just like 'Here's your cublicle. Here's your computer. Your job is to, like, stay awake as many hours as you can and be accurate, you know, to the third decimal place. Go.' I just, I couldn't understand what was happening in that space, and I couldn't understand why all these, you know, bright, excited young people were finding themselves here. I think I had a moment there where I was just like 'I'm gonna die. And is this what I want to do? Like, day to day.'  
Interviewer: Goldman Sachs was your NDE.  
[Whispers] Oh my God! Yes! I was just thinking to myself 'My therapist would love that.' Like yeah, you're right...  
I remember a moment of, I had been there for a period. I was a, a new analyst, but I happened to be staffed on two companies where they were having IPOs at the same time. So the volume of work was crazy. And, I got sick, and, um, there was really no time for that. You know? So you had to just be there anyway. And then I was also just sad. You know, like I would go home from work, and sometimes just cry. And it wasn't just like a few tears; it was the kind of existential crying of like--It was heartbreak. I was heart--I was heartbroken that--Y-you brought this up earlier, the idea of like 'When does a kid lose their imagination? When do they let go of that wild, unbridled thing and become the broken-in horse?' That was the moment for me.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I remember seeing a doctor, telling the doctor that I was having like these waves of sadness, and he was just like 'You're depressed. Here's a prescription for Paxil.' I remember filling the prescription, and it was sitting on my nightstand, and I would come home and be so sad, and I would look at that bottle, and I would think 'Something is wrong here if, like, I'm being told--like I'm doing something that's making me not feel good, and I'm being told that the answer is to just like pop one of these pills.', to make the thing palatable, to just go do the job..And I have so much empathy for that...To numb yourself, bascially. And the doctor's answer, the "System"'s answer was 'Well, there are ways to medicate this so that you don't feel your body's gut reaction.' You just go with what your mind is saying, which is like 'If I do this job, I know exactly how much money I'll be making in two years, how much money I'll make in five years, prolly how much I'll make in ten.'  
Interviewer: Who I'll date, who I'll marry, where I'll live.  
Hundred percent. What are the zip codes? What are the things that I'll have?  
Interviewer: The private school I'll go to, the college I'll bribe.  
[Laughs] And I don't even mean any of that in a dispariaging way, like, I really understand there's such great comfort that comes in being able to feel like you--there's some safety and security in your future, and I don't judge it at all. But for me, in my body I was like reaching a place of, of dysfunction. And I, I couldn't, I couldn't bring myself to take the medication. And that was the moment that I was like..I was just like 'I can't--I have to find a different thing.'...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I was thinking in my rational mind 'I'm on two projects that have IPOs. I should really spend all day Saturday and Sunday at the office.' But then here are my friends, and they want to do this fun thing. And so I took the leap, and we did it. And we got a topic. We didn't sleep for 48 hours; we just made this film over the weekend. It was a total piece of shit, but I had so much fun. And I was like 'Okay, I can work my butt off doing something that I love. And it's dangerous, and I might never make any money, you know, and I may be broke all the time, but I'll be *happy*, I'll be delighted, like--Or I can do this thing that doesn't feel right in my body, where I know there are predictable safe outcomes.' And to me suddenly then it just--It actually wasn't a choice anymore. I just seemed so obvious, like 'I have to go this other way.'  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So it's like suddenly you get rid of the safety net, and you're just like 'I accept that my life is gonna be on a high wire, and I'm gonna put one foot in front of the other every day. And it's gonna be dangerous, and I'm probably--and there's the fear of falling, but I'm gonna just keep going on this thing with no net, believing that it..believing that it will make a more interesting life.', like lived life, and that that will be better than the version where you're just, you're on the ground in the net."

Because the only truth you know is what you get over this tube. Right now, there is a whole and entire generation that never knew anything that didn't come out of this tube. This tube is the Gospel, the Ultimate Revelation. This tube can make or break presidents, popes, prime ministers. This tube is the most awesome goddamn force in the whole godless world! And woe is us if it ever falls in to the hands of the wrong people....And when the 12th largest company in the world controls the most awesome goddamn propaganda force in the whole godless world, who knows what shit will be peddled for truth on this network!? So you listen to me. Listen to me! Television is not the truth. Television's a goddamned amusement park. Television is a circus, a carnival, a traveling troupe of acrobats, storytellers, dancers, singers, jugglers, sideshow freaks, lion-tamers, and football players. We're in the boredom-killing business! So if you want the truth, got to God. Go to your gurus. Go to yourselves. Because that's the only place you're ever gonna find any real truth.

We'll tell you any shit your want to hear. We deal in illusions, man. None of it is true! But you people sit there day after day, night after night, all ages, colors, creeds. We're all you know. You're beginning to believe the illusions we're spinning here. You're beginning to think that the tube is reality and that your own lives are unreal. You *do* whatever the tube tells you.

The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country, and now they must put it back! It is ebb and flow, tidal gravity. It is ecological balance. You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples. There are no nations. There are no peoples. There are no Russions. There are no Arabs. There are no Third Worlds. There is no West! There is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars. Petrol dollars, electro-dollars, multi-dollars, reichsmarks, rins, rubles, pounds, and shekels. It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today. That is the atomic, and subatomic, and galactic structure of things today. And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature. And you will atone! Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale? You get up on your little 21 inch screen and howl about America and democracy. There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and Dupont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today. What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state? Karl Marx? They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories, minimax solutions and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments just like we do. We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale. The world is a college of corporations, inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business. The world is a business, Mr. Beale. It has been since man crawled out of the slime. And our children will live, Mr. Beale, to see that perfect world in which there's no war or famine oppression or brutality, one vast and ecumenical holding company for whom all men will work to serve a common profit, in which all men will hold a share of stock, all necessities provided, all anxieties tranquilized, all boredom amused.

And I don't mean the communists are gonna take over the world, because the communists are deader than we are. What is finished is the idea that this great counry is dedicated to the freedom and flourishing of every individual in it. It's the individual that's finished. It's the single, solitary human being that's finished. It's every single one of you out there that's finished, because this is no longer a nation of independent individuals. It's a nation of some 200-odd million transistorized, deodorized, whiter than white, steel-belted bodies, totally unnecessary as human beings and as replaceable as piston rods....The whole world's people are becoming mass-produced, programmed, numbered, insensate things."

"Rather, I want to suggest what may be a wider lesson about software, (and probably about every kind of creative or professional work). Human beings generally take pleasure in a task when it falls in a sort of optimal-challenge zone; not so easy as to be boring, not too hard to achieve. A happy programmer is one who is neither underutilized nor weighed down with ill-formulated goals and stressful process friction. *Enjoyment predicts efficiency.*"

"And they go 'I'm sorry, you're not good-looking enough.' And I know I'm not easy on the eyes. I know God did not tap me with the beauty stick. Alright? But I guarantee you when those lights are off they're gonna be like 'I'm glad Andrew was there.'"  
--Andrew, Reno 911! 5.5

NYTimes interviewer: "But why does compassion have to be universal?"  
"Because this is different from moral judgment. It doesn't prevent you from saying [Putin and Assad] are walking psychopaths. But compassion is to remedy suffering wherever it is, whatever form it takes, and whomever causes it. If someone beats you with a stick, you don't get angry with the stick, you get angry with the person. These people we are talking about are like sticks in the hands of ignorance and hatred."  
--Matthieu Ricard, 2023

"If you can cultivate that quality of human warmth, wanting genuinely for other people to be happy, that's the best way to fulfill your own happiness. This is also the most gratifying state of mind. If we try humbly to enhance our benevolence, that will be the best way to have a good life."

"If man is to survive, he will have learned to take a delight in the essential differences between men and between cultures. He will learn that differences in ideas and attitudes are a delight, part of life's exciting variety, not something to fear."   
--Gene Roddenberry

"Star Trek was an attempt to say that humanity will reach maturity and wisdom on the day that it begins not just to tolerate, but take a special delight in differences in ideas and differences in life forms. […] If we cannot learn to actually enjoy those small differences, to take a positive delight in those small differences between our own kind, here on this planet, then we do not deserve to go out into space and meet the diversity that is almost certainly out there."  
--Gene Roddenberry

"It is the struggle itself that is most important. We must strive to be more than we are. It does not matter that we will not reach our ultimate goal. The effort itself yields its own reward."  
--Gene Roddenberry

"Reality is incredibly larger, infinitely more exciting, than the flesh and blood vehicle we travel in here. If you read science fiction, the more you read it the more you realize that you and the universe are part of the same thing. Science knows still practically nothing about the real nature of matter, energy, dimension, or time; and even less about those remarkable things called life and thought. But whatever the meaning and purpose of this universe, you are a legitimate part of it. And since you are part of the all that is, part of its purpose, there is more to you than just this brief speck of existence. You are just a visitor here in this time and this place, a traveler through it."  
--Gene Roddenberry

"This is what I give. I give an expression of care every day to each child, to help him realize that he is unique. I end the program by saying 'You've made this day a special day by just your being you. There's no person in the whole world like you, and I like you just the way you are.' And I feel that if we in public television can only make it clear that feelings are mentionable and manageable, we will have done a great service."

"I think that those who would try to make you feel less than who you are, I think that's the greatest evil."

He truly embodied the principles of being genuinely interested in other people, showing them real appreciation, and giving away vast quantities of love, never stopping to become embittered by a world that may not return those sentiments initially.  

"In one particularly telling real-world example from 2016 of how such cuts affected students in the “brick and mortar” district, high school junior Jameria Miller talks about why she starts every morning running through the school to get a good seat near the front of the room in her first-period Spanish class. It’s not because she is just excited about the class. It’s because the school is cold. As she explains, “The cold is definitely a distraction. We race to class to get the best blankets.” What she means is that because the classroom where she begins her day has uninsulated metal walls, Jameria’s teacher hands out blankets to the students on a first come, first served basis. It’s the only way for them to stay warm. Miller’s school in the William Penn District is situated in Philadelphia’s “inner-ring” suburbs and serves a student body that is majority Black and overwhelmingly impoverished. Though concentrating in the cold is hard enough, Miller says the hardest part of her daily ordeal is the knowledge that life isn’t like this for students in other districts. She means students in wealthier districts. “It’s never going to be fair, they’re always going to be a step ahead of us. They’ll have more money than us, and they’ll get better jobs than us, always.” She says she doesn’t believe that either funding or systemic school improvement will ever truly equalize: 'What I'm about to say might not be very nice, but rich people aren’t going to want [funding fairness]. They want their kids to have better things so that their kids can get a jump start in life and be ahead of everyone else. And, as long as people feel that way, we all won’t be equal. We won’t receive equal education ever, because education is what gets you success.'"

"Often in relationships between men and women, there is this weird pact that it's the women's job to interpret their relationship for the men. That they have a right to say, 'The problem with you is that you're afraid of commitment, and if only you would show up at my house at an approximately reasonable time, then we would be fine.' And that is bullshit: that the men are ready to outsource their own understanding of themselves to the women, and that the women will do that job so the men will do what they want. And yet it's a sort of agreed-upon game."  
...  
'For Roupenian, it has been a case of recognizing a tendency to overestimate the extend to which "someone else has control over my happiness and ability to move in the world", and, by extension, her control over others: "That if you're unhappy, it's my fault, and my job to fix it. I do have a responsibility to make other people happy. You have to be a good person. But that is contradicted by the thing I have felt increasingly as I get older, which is that I do not have the power to make you happy. My ability to fix you is so limited, and my desire to fix you is complicated. For me, the process of getting older and seeing things more truly has been realizing how little power we have over each other."'
...
"To me, part of the anxiety that can come in romantic relationships is 'I have a story that is unraveling.' That can be really hard. It's caught up in ego and power and control, which is separate from 'Maybe this person likes me; maybe they don't.'"

“From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here, that's home, that's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar", every "supreme leader", every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there----on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conciets than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”

"Those worlds in space are as countless as all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the earth. Each  of those worlds is as real as ours. In every one of them there’s a succession of incidents, events, occurrences which influence its future. Countless worlds, numberless moments, an immensity of space and time. And our small planet at this moment: here we face a critical branch point in history. What we do with our world right now will propagate down through the centuries and powerfully affect the destiny of our descendents. It is well within our power to destroy our civilization and perhaps our species as well. If we capitulate to superstition or greed or stupidity, we could plunge our world into a darkness deeper than the time between the collapse of classical civilization and the Italian  Renaissance. But we’re also capable of using our compassion and our intelligence, our technology and our wealth, to make an abundant and meaningful life for every inhabitant of this planet, to enhance  enormously our understanding of the universe and to carry us to the stars."

"[W]e’ve misunderstood Frankenstein. The lesson is not that we shouldn’t try to create new technologies—or create life, even—the lesson is that we never abandon our creations.

"When I was in college the Cold War had just ended. I entered college the same year the Soviet Union collapsed. And for a variety of reasons I developed this interest in mid-20th century literature by anti-totalitarian writers, people like Hannah Arendt and Miłosz and a bunch of other figures both from behind the Iron Curtain--Václav Havel--and in the Free World who really thought deeply about the totalitarian phenomenon. And what has struck me profoundly in the last 5 or 6 years is how the psychological categories--the desire to obey, the willingness to be misled so long as you're made to feel as if you belong--, that those methods by which totalitarianism or post-totalitarianism societies were able to rule and to stay in power, that the Trump playbook recalls those methods to an eerie degree, and it's really worth re-reading those books."

"Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that 'computer science' is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called *procedural epistemology*--the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of 'what is'. Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of 'how to'."

"I hesitate to give advice because every major single piece of advice I was given turned out to be wrong and I am glad I didn’t follow them. I was told to focus and I never did. I was told to never procrastinate and I waited 20 years for the Black Swan and it sold 3 million copies. I was told to avoid putting fictional characters in my books and I did put in Nero Tulip and Fat Tony because I got bored otherwise. I was told to not insult the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, the more I insulted them the nicer they were to me and solicit Op-Eds. I was told to avoid lifting weights for a back pain and became a weightlifter: never had a back problem since.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If I had to relive my life I would be even more stubborn and uncompromising than I have been. One should never do anything without skin in the game. If you give advice, you need to be exposed to losses from it."  
--Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"So when we look at religion and, to some extent ancestral superstitions, we should consider what purpose they serve, rather than focusing on the notion of “belief”, epistemic belief in its strict scientific definition. In science, belief is literal belief; it is right or wrong, never metaphorical. In real life, belief is an instrument to do things, not the end product. This is similar to vision: the purpose of your eyes is to orient you in the best possible way, and get you out of trouble when needed, or help you find a prey at distance. Your eyes are not sensors aimed at getting the electromagnetic spectrum of reality. Their job description is not to produce the most accurate scientific representation of reality; rather the most useful one for survival."  
--Nassim Nicholas Taleb, *Skin in the Game*

"If there's an enormous problem with the world, and we can convince ourselves that over some long but not unreasonable period of time we can make that problem go away, then we don't need a business plan.

"To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting."  
--Lao Tzu

"He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign. If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."  
--Lao Tzu

"The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself."  
--Lao Tzu

"Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy who is already defeated. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself in to a position that makes defeat impossible and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory."

"That general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack."

--David Foster Wallace

"Blind certainty: A closed-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn't even know he's locked up."  
--David Foster Wallace

"But if you really *learn how to think*, how to pay attention, then you will know you have other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell-type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that lit the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down--not that that mystical stuff's necessarily true; the only thing that's capital-T True is that you get to decide how you're gonna try to see it.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This, I submit, is the freedom of real education, of learning how to be 'well adjusted': You get to consiously decide what has meaning and what doesn't. You get to decide what to *worship*. Because here's something else that's weird but true: In the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshiping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is *what* to worship. And a compelling reason for *maybe* choosing some sort of God or spiritual-type thing to worship, be it JC or Allah, be it Yahweh or the Wiccan mother goddess or the four noble truths or some inviolable set of ethical principles, is that prettymuch anything else you worship will *eat you alive*.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure, and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On one level we all know this stuff already. It's been codified as myths, proverbs, cliches, epigrams, parables, the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciouness.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Worship power; you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Look, the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful; it is that they are *unconscious*. They are default settings. They're the kind of worship you just gradually slip in to, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value, without ever being fully aware that that's what you're doing.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And the so-called 'real world' will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called 'real world' of *men* and *money* and *power* hums merrily along on the fuel of *fear* and *anger* and *frustration* and *craving* and the worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom, the freedom all to be lords of our own tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the center of all creation.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talked about in the great outside world of wanting and achieving and displaying. The really important kind of freedom involves *attention* and *awareness* and *discipline* and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day. That is real freedom. That is being educated and understanding *how to think*.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the *rat race*, the constant gnawing sense of having had and lost some infinite thing. ...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death. The capital-T Truth is about life *before* death. It is about the *real* value of a *real* education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge and everything to do with simple awareness, awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us all the time that we have to keep reminding ourselves, over and over: 'This is water.' 'This is water.'  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out, which means yet another grand cliche turns out to be true: Your education really is the job of a lifetime, and it commences now. I wish you way more than luck."

"The men ask me questions like, 'How would you calculate the number of people who work for the United States Postal Service?' and 'How would you describe the internet to a medieval farmer?' and 'What is the hardest thing you've ever done?' They tell me to stand in front of the whiteboard and diagram my responses. These questions are self-conscious and infuriating, but it only serves to fuel me. I want to impress; I refuse to be discouraged by their self-importance. Here is a character flaw, my industry origin story: I have always responded positively to negging."

"My third interview is with the technical cofounder. He enters the conference room in a crisp blue button-down, looking confidently unprepared. He tells me--apologetically--that he hasn't done many interviews before, and as such he doesn't have a ton of questions to ask me. Nonetheless, the office manager slated an hour for our conversation. This seems OK: I figure we will talk about the company, I will ask routine follow-up questions, and at four they will let me out for the day, like a middle school student, and the city will absorb me and my private errors. Then he tells me that his girlfriend is applying to law school and he's been helping her prep. So instead of a conventional interview, he's just going to have me take a section of the LSAT. I search his face to see if he's kidding."   
"'If it's cool with you, I'm just going to hang out here and check my email.' he says, sliding the test across the table and opening a laptop. He sets a timer."

...  
"I look around the room and feel a wave of affection for these men, this small group of misfits who are the only people who understand this new backbone to my life."  
...  
"I think about the city I left to come here, the plans I've canceled and the friends I haven't made. I think about how hard I've worked and how demoralizing it is to fail.

It will be months until I call it quits; it will take almost a year to realize I was gaslighting myself, that I was reading from someone else's script."

"A deus ex machina is generally deemed undesirable in writing and often implies a lack of creativity on the part of the author. The reasons for this are that it does not pay due regard to the story's internal logic (although it is sometimes deliberately used to do this) and is often so unlikely that it challenges suspension of disbelief, allowing the author to conclude the story with an unlikely, though perhaps more palatable, ending."
