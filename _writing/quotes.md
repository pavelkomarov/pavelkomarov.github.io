I've tried to make these as accurate as I can, but I'm sure there are still misattributions and errors. The point is each one has been uniquely meaningful or interesting or funny in some way at some point. May they guide you as well.

"Anarchism is founded on the observation that since few men are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others."  
--Edward Abbey

--Douglas Adams

“When you walk through the storm, hold your head high  
And don't be afraid of the dark!  
At the end of the storm is a golden sky  
And the sweet song of the lark.  
Walk on through the wind  
Walk on through the rain  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown  
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart  
And you'll never walk alone!”  
--Douglas Adams

"...they discovered only a small asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying."  
--Douglas Adams

"Well, I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point, I'm afraid, where you begin to suspect that the entire multidimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs. And if it comes to a choice between spending yet another ten million years finding that out, and on the other hand just taking the money and running, then I for one could do with the exercise."  
--Douglas Adams

"and we’ll be saying a big hello to all intelligent life forms everywhere … and to everyone else out there, the secret is to bang the rocks together, guys."  
--Douglas Adams

"Vogon poetry is of course, the third worst in the universe. 
The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their poet master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning" four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging, and the president of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos was reported to have been "disappointed" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his 12-book epic entitled "My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles" when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save humanity, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain."  
--Douglas Adams

“Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The argument goes something like this: "I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"But," says Man, "The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED."  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"Oh, that was easy," says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.”  
--Douglas Adams

"I love deadlines. I love the wooshing sound they make as they go by."  
--Douglas Adams

"The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't."  
--Douglas Adams

"'You talked to it?' exclaimed Ford. 'What do you mean you talked to it?' 'Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its extermal computer feed. I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it,' said Marvin. 'And what happened?' pressed Ford. 'it commited suicide,' said Marvin, and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold."  
--Douglas Adams

"'Yes I passed on your message to Mr. Zarniwoop, but I'm afraid he's too cool to see you right now.' 'Look,' said Zaphod, 'I'm up to here with cool, okay? I am so amazingly cool you could keep a side of meat in me for a month. I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis.'"  
--Douglas Adams

"'Listen, three eyes,' he said, 'don't you try to outweird me, I get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal.'"

--Douglas Adams

"'So, how are you?' he said aloud. 'Oh, fine,' said Marvin, 'if you happend to like being me, which personally I don't.'"  
--Douglas Adams

"'Hello,' said the elevator sweetly, 'I am to be your elevator for this trip to the floor of your choice. ...' 'Yeah,' said Zaphod, stepping into it, 'what else do you do besides talk?' 'I go up,' said the elevator, 'or down.' 'Good,' said Zaphod, 'we're going up.' 'Or down,' the elevator reminded him. 'Yeah, okay, up please.' There was a moment of silence. 'Down's very nice,' suggested the elevator hopefully. 'Oh yeah?' 'Super.' 'Good,' said Zaphod, 'now will you take us up?' 'May I ask you,' inquired the elevator in its sweetest, most reasonable voice, 'if you've considered all the possibilities that down might offer you?' Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall."  
--Douglas Adams

"Modern elevators are strange and complex entities. The ancient electric winch and "maximum-capacity-eight-persons" jobs bear as much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital."  
--Douglas Adams

"The desk, apart from a bit of dancing dust and a single, revolutionary new form of paper clip, was empty."

--Aeschylus

"I don't like a state or culture that so obeys authority. Germany is a very precise society. Its people love the comfort of being oppressed. In China, too, you see that. Once you're used to it, it can be very enjoyable. And you can see the efficiency, the show, the sense of their power being extended through the connected-mind condition. ... They identify with the cult of that authoritarian mindset."  
--[Ai Weiwei](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/21/ai-weiwei-on-his-new-life-in-britain-germany-virtual-reality-film)

"What about you, Colonel?  
My job isn't to believe or disbelieve. It's to act or not to act.  
...  
The other day, a young researcher asked me something.
He wondered if their power was the form the next stage of human evolution was taking, and perhaps that we'll all be able to control it some day.  
Scientists are a bunch of romantics. Military men always consider the risks first. It's taken thirty long years. We've come so far from the rubble. We can't just trade one for the other.  
I've always thought that you hated this city, Colonel.  
The passion to build has cooled and the joy of reconstruction forgotten, and now it's just a garbage heap made up of hedonistic fools.  
So you're trying to save the city, then?  
It's how a soldier thinks. A scientist wouldn't understand."  
--[Akira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(1988_film))

"Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact; it's an opinion. It's a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing."  
--Muhammad Ali

--Lester Bangs, *Almost Famous*

"Show me any guy who ever said he didn't want to be popular, and I'll show you a scared guy...It's much safer to say popularity sucks, because that allows you to forgive yourself if you suck. And I don't forgive myself. Do you?"

"[Governmental] legitimacy is not solely---not even primarily---a product of the procedures that agencies follow. Legitimacy arises more generally from the perception that government is capable, informed, prompt, responsive, and fair."  
--[Nicholas Bagley](https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-procedure-fetish/)

"The word [*virtù*] derives from the Latin *virtus* which covers a range of meaning from moral uprightness to physical prowess, and its root in turn is *vir*, a man: to act with *virtù* is to display within the demands of a given situation those qualities of assertive energy which can transcend it, to display virility in fact. As its etymology indicates it is a strictly masculine concept--women appear in Machiavelli chiefly as tokens of male honour. In general, then *virtù* denotes those qualities of energy, courage, genius and resource which support self-determination; at its highest it gives purpose and direction to the drift of events and forces back the boundaries of chance."  
--Dominic Baker-Smith, introduction to *The Prince*, reminded me of "Be a man; do the right thing.", very yang rather than yin

"Machiavelli is invariably hostile to passivity, and what fortune has given she can with ease take away. ... This is why the prince who has relied least on fortune is actually better placed; not only has he been tested in his rise to power, but he is fully alert to the dangers which threaten his position."  
--Dominic Baker-Smith, introduction to *The Prince*

"[H]umble origin is a common trait of oustanding men, presenting a challenge which initiates their rise to power."  
--Dominic Baker-Smith, introduction to *The Prince*

"This is why gratuitous cruelty is condemned, not on moral grounds exactly but because it is self-defeating."  
--Dominic Baker-Smith, introduction to *The Prince*

"... the dialectic between fortune and talent ... *Fortuna* ... he seems to visualize her, along with her ally *Occasio*, in terms of traditional iconography: she is a woman and, as such, most responsive to those audacious enough to try and master her. ... Fortune may direct a half, or slightly more, of human endeavor, but an element of control is possible, and the opportunities she provides can be exploited by those with spirit. Even if she had such a major say in events, there is still a good deal left to the resources of *virtù*. The thing that is absolutely essential, as Machiavelli carefully emphasizes, is to remain alert and open to the changing circumstances of the times; so many who start out well fail through inflexibility. Adaptability is a necessary requirement for success"  
--Dominic Baker-Smith, introduction to *The Prince*

"I bought a house, bought a car, bought a pair of jeans  
bought a surfboard, bought a breakfast, bought beyond my means  
bought the items that you told me would enrich me,

"[T]he reason why Trump was elected, and the reason why there is such incredible polarization in society right now, is because the top 10% of earners in the United States have been so focused on ensuring that they not only maintain but also extend their privilege. And for me the scandal that really summarized all of this was Varsity Blues and all of these very wealthy people that were doing everything possible to ensure that their kids---not deservant---found a way to get into those best schools. And when I saw that Greenwich Connecticut, that *50%* of high schoolers taking the SAT out of Greenwich had letters from doctors that allowed them to take it with no time restrictions, unmonitored---that-that's not just rigged; I mean, that is *the* system. That's structural."  
-[Ian Bremmer, *Real Time with Bill Maher*, May 29th 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8a78lMXmAE&t=5m31s)

"The people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it."  
--Brené Brown

"Any book on happiness is likely to tell you to set clear goals on what you want to achieve and then work towards achieving them. The problem is it doesn't really work. You might become a millionaire by the time you're 40, but then you realize you haven't been able to sustain a happy relationship. Or when it doesn't work out you feel lost, and you blame yourself. When we live for our goals, we forget to live *now*. The philosopher Allen Watts made the point that when you listen to a piece of music, you don't just skip to the end because that's where it all comes together. You don't just read the last chapter of a book because that's the climax. Yet in life we're obsessed with endings. So you study for these exams so you can go to this university to get this job to work your way up to what? Eventually you reach some position in your 50s and you think "Is this it? Is this the thing? Is this what I've been working for?" And you forget that maybe life should be more like a piece of music, and you're supposed to be dancing."  
--Derren Brown

"We tend to dwell on our pasts and think that they somehow define who we are. But our pasts are just stories that we tell ourselves in the present...And we can be more skeptical of those stories if it helps us...We forget to apply the same natural skepticism to the most important stories we have, the ones we tell ourselves every day about who we are. And we can choose to change those stories."  
--Derren Brown

"This idea that those stories define us, in other words that it isn't really events that cause our problems but more our reactions to them, this all goes back to a Roman philosopher called Epictetus 2000 years ago. And Epictetus also gave us a great piece of advice, which I find helpful every day. Epictetus said there are things in your life that you're in control of, and then there are things in your life that you're not in control of. So if you stop trying to control or change things that are not under your control anyway, you will of course remove a whole lot of pointless frustration and anxiety from your life. Right? He added to that: There are only two things that you are in control of: Your thoughts and your actions. That's it. So everything else, what other people do, what they think, what they think of you, how they behave, you can't control any of that anyway. So if you stop trying to, if you stop trying to fix it or change it in some way, if you just decide that anything on that side is fine and just let it go, nothing bad happens. You just feel better. You feel happier. You feel relief like you just put down a big heavy case of bricks."  
--Derren Brown

"...That is a miracle. And we can remember that when we tell ourselves we're a bit fat or our lives are a bit rubbish. This is the one life and the one body we have. We can tell ourselves a different story about it at least. We can be kinder to ourselves."  
--Derren Brown, *Miracle*

"I strongly believe that engaging with life is about understanding that it's the choices we make right now that are important, not the habits of our past."

"Living life fully is not just about fulfilling ambition, regardless of what motivational books tell you. It's also about being kinder."  
--Derren Brown

"Life is no longer as hard, but life is more complicated."

"About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some won't like you at all."  
--Rita Mae Brown

"Good judgment comes from experience, and often experience comes from bad judgment."  
--Rita Mae Brown

"The problem today isn't that jobs are scarcer, or that positions in schools are fewer. It's that we live in a hypercompetitive order, where the competition is not just for arriving, but the competition is never-ending. Every human being is now requied to understand themselves as a little bit of human capital."  
--Wendy Brown, *Take Your Pills*

"There are many ways of breaking a heart. Stories were full of hearts broken by love, but what really broke a heart was taking away its dream--whatever that dream might be."  
--Pearl S. Buck

"Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned."

"This is the recipe. What they're going to do to these Nordic peoples is that they're going to turn them into reputable members of the international community....This is an age-old strategy that has worked on all sorts of peoples. I mean, to just name a few you could say the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths and the Lombards and the Vandals and, yes, a couple of centuries before this time period, even the Franks themselves were in this same situation, and the Romans cooked them using the recipe into nice, civilized states. Now the term 'cooked' is the way the Chinese used to describe this process when they used to do almost the very same thing to the so-called barbarians on their borders....Certain things tend to work, and so you see them brought up again and again. And this idea of 'cooking the barbarians' next door is something you see over and over, and the recipe is different place to place. Like the Chinese version doesn't include Christianity. The version here in the European context does....In effect, what the recipe is is destroying the culture of the peoples you're targeting and then replacing it with one more like your own. The reasons one can do this with a clear conscience is what makes this sort of a dual-use kind of strategy for a Frankish ruler or a Byzantine ruler. And by dual use I mean there's a wonderful way one can console onesself thinking one is doing a favor for the very people on the receiving end of this treatment. If you are a Christian ruler, for example, and you are bringing the Christian religion to a bunch of pagans and a bunch of heathens, you are doing them a great deed. This is a gift. You are helping them potentially get in to heaven. You are showing them the truth....You are showing them the error of their ways, and this makes you a better person for doing so. At the same time, this will create conditions on your border that are much more stable, controllable, answerable, and that will long-term eliminate your pirate problem....  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In this time period, Christianity shouldn't be thought of the way somebody might think of it today, like merely a spiritual change of focus....It is truly, let's call it a 'civilizational commitment'. And this is one of the big selling points, by the way. If you're trying to sell this to a potential Viking ruler, somebody you could back and get behind and say 'Hey, let me tell you why you should convert to Christianity and why your people should and what's in it for you.' I mean, it is essentially instant legitimacy for a ruler, instant legitimacy for his dynastic successors--so dynastic security--, instant infrastructure, and instant literacy. Just add Jesus. We're going to bring in educated people who write. They'll start chronicling your story, your history, the greatness of your people, your crop yields, all of that overnight. Right? Literacy will arrive. We'll start building things. We'll start teaching your people. The whole thing is state building in a very real sense of the word."  
--Dan Carlin, Twilight of the Aesir I, ~2:50:00

"I was a theatre major for my first two years in college, and I remember ... when I shifted to history--which had been a lifelong interest; it was the most natural thing to do that.--I remember thinking 'Damn I just wasted two years of college.' Right? I just *wasted all that time* and shifted to history with an emphasis on like ancient and military and all these kinds of things. So now you find yourself in a position, which, as my dad said, you never could have connected the dots at the end of your life on how you got there, and all of a sudden I'm using the theatre and the military and ancient history *every day* in my job, in a job that didn't exist when I was in college. You couldn't have even said 'Well maybe I'll go in to podcasting and figure out a way to make it all work.' And yet there you are. Right? None of the tools that you'd been taught, that whole theatre of the mind with radio, that's all stuff that I ended up using. And so with my kids--One of 'em's in college. The other's gonna to go to college soon.--I try to teach them the same thing, that 'Look, don't worry about this if you feel like you're wasting you're time', 'cause they all feel like you need to be in whatever you're gonna be in--You know, if you're gonna be an accountant for a living, you better be in accounting school. And I just keep telling them 'None of this'll be wasted. Somehow, some way this is all gonna be stuff you can repurpose and weave in to some story.' ...

"Often when people discuss behavior change, when they talk about habits they want to shift, it’s usually centered around some kind of goal. They start with like 'Oh I want to lose 40lbs' or 'I'd like to double my income' or 'I want to reduce stress.' They have some kind of outcome that they want. And so the implicit assumption behind that is 'If I can just achieve this thing, then I'll be the kind of person I want to be. Then I'll have', you know, 'the life I wanna have.'...Most of your outcomes in life are a lagging measure of your habits. So for example your knowledge is a lagging measure of your reading and learning habits. Your bank account is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your physical fitness is a lagging measure of your eating and training habits. Even the clutter on your desk at work or in the garage or in your bedroom is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. And so if you get really motivated and set a big goal like 'I have the goal to clean my room', and then you spend a couple hours doing that, you have a clean room--for now. But if you don’t change the sloppy, messy habits that led to a dirty room in the first place, then you turn around two weeks later, and you’ve got a dirty room again. So we often think that the outputs are the things that need to change, but it's not really the results that need to change; it’s like 'Fix the inputs, and the outputs will fix themselves.'...Process over outcome."

"By the Closed Mode I mean the mode that we are in most of the time when we're at work. We have inside us a feeling that there's lots to be done, and we have to get on with it if we're going to get through it all. It's an active, probably slightly anxious mode, although the anxiety can be exciting and pleasurable. It's a mode in which we're probably a little impatient, if only with ourselves. It has a little tension in it, not much humor. It's a mode in which we're very purposeful, and it's a mode in which we can get very stressed and even a bit manic, but not creative.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;By contrast the Open Mode is a relaxed, expansive, less purposeful mode, in which we're probably more contemplative, more inclined to humor, which always accompanies a wider perspective, and consequently more playful. It's a mood in which curiosity for its own sake can operate, because we're not under pressure to get a specific thing done quickly. We can play. And that is what allows our natural creativity to surface."

"These days, every politician is a laughing-stock, and the laughter which occasionally used to illuminate the dark corners of the political world with dazzling, unexpected shafts of hilarity has become an unthinking reflex on our part, a tired Pavlovian reaction to situations that are too difficult or too depressing to think about clearly."

And I guess I'm either a Catholic or a Buddhist when I say those things, 'cause I've heard those from both traditions.

"It doesn't mean you are happy this--"  
"I don't want it to have happened. I want it to not have happened. But, if you are grateful for your life, which I think is a positive thing to do--Not everybody is, and I'm not always, but it's the most positive thing to do.--, then you have to be grateful for all of it. You can't pick and choose what you're grateful for. And then, so what do you get from loss? You get awareness of other people's loss"  
"Well that's true, empathy."  
"which allows you to connect with that other person, which allows you to love more deeply and to understand what it's like to be a human being, if it's true that all humans suffer. And so, at a young age I suffered something so that by the time I was in serious relationships in my life, with friends, or with my wife, or with my children, I have some understanding that everybody is suffering and, however imperfectly, acknowledge their suffering to connect with them and to love in a deep way that not only accepts that all of us suffer but then also makes you grateful that you have suffered so that you can know that about other people. And that's what I mean. It's but the fullness of your humanity. What's the point of being here and being human if you can't be the most human you can be? I'm not saying best, 'cause you can be a bad person and a most human. I want to be the most human I can be. And that involves acknowledging and ultimately being grateful for the things that I wish didn't happen, because they gave me a gift."

"There are good and bad features of modern family life, in which relations are often based more on ties of affection than on duty or obedience. In these times, the people we choose to be close to represent not only a preference, but a profound statement of our identities. We are freed to surround ourselves with those who reflect our deepest values—parents included. We feel empowered to call on loved ones to be more sensitive to our needs, our emotions, and our aspirations. This freedom enables us to become untethered and protected from hurtful or abusive family members.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Yet in less grave scenarios our American love affair with the needs and rights of the individual conceals how much sorrow we create for those we leave behind. We may see cutting off family members as courageous rather than avoidant or selfish. We can convince ourselves that it’s better to go it alone than to do the work it takes to resolve conflict. Some problems may be irresolvable, but there are also relationships that don’t need to be lost forever.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is sometimes tempting to see family members as one more burden in an already demanding life. It can be hard to see their awkward attempts to care for us, the confounding nature of their struggles, and the history they carry stumbling into the present. It can be difficult to apologize to those we’ve hurt and hard to forgive those who have hurt us. But sometimes the benefits outweigh the costs. Tara Westover wrote in her memoir, *Educated*, 'I know only this: that when my mother told me she had not been the mother to me that she wished she’d been, she became that mother for the first time.'  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We are all flawed. We should have that at the forefront of our minds when deciding who to keep in or out of our lives—and how to respond to those who no longer want us in theirs."

You feel like you are burnt out or that you are on the verge of burning out, but in reality you are on the verge of deciding whether or not you will burn out.

"When we put our butt on the cushion to meditate, in many of these traditions we invoke the intention that I'm going to sit and meditate not primarily for my own benefit, but for the benefit of others.

In meditation the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex literally exerts inhibitory control on the amygdala (emotional salience center of the brain for a whole range of emotions, positive and negative) and default mode network (associated with self narrative), which strengthens the connection there and allows us to better modulate responses over time, eventually leading to less reactive emotions and less modulatory input required.

"[S]tudents from elite schools expect success, and expect it now. They have, by definition, never experienced anything else, and their sense of self has been built around their ability to succeed. The idea of not being successful terrifies them, disorients them, defeats them. They’ve been driven their whole lives by a fear of failure—often, in the first instance, by their parents’ fear of failure. The first time I blew a test, I walked out of the room feeling like I no longer knew who I was. The second time, it was easier; I had started to learn that failure isn’t the end of the world.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But if you’re afraid to fail, you’re afraid to take risks, which begins to explain the final and most damning disadvantage of an elite education: that it is profoundly anti-intellectual. This will seem counterintuitive. Aren’t kids at elite schools the smartest ones around, at least in the narrow academic sense? Don’t they work harder than anyone else—indeed, harder than any previous generation? They are. They do. But being an intellectual is not the same as being smart. Being an intellectual means more than doing your homework.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If so few kids come to college understanding this, it is no wonder. They are products of a system that rarely asked them to think about something bigger than the next assignment. The system forgot to teach them, along the way to the prestige admissions and the lucrative jobs, that the most important achievements can’t be measured by a letter or a number or a name. It forgot that the true purpose of education is to make minds, not careers.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Being an intellectual means, first of all, being passionate about ideas—and not just for the duration of a semester, for the sake of pleasing the teacher, or for getting a good grade. A friend who teaches at the University of Connecticut once complained to me that his students don’t think for themselves. Well, I said, Yale students think for themselves, but only because they know we want them to. I’ve had many wonderful students at Yale and Columbia, bright, thoughtful, creative kids whom it’s been a pleasure to talk with and learn from. But most of them have seemed content to color within the lines that their education had marked out for them. Only a small minority have seen their education as part of a larger intellectual journey, have approached the work of the mind with a pilgrim soul. These few have tended to feel like freaks, not least because they get so little support from the university itself. Places like Yale, as one of them put it to me, are not conducive to searchers. [explorers]  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Places like Yale are simply not set up to help students ask the big questions. I don’t think there ever was a golden age of intellectualism in the American university, but in the 19th century students might at least have had a chance to hear such questions raised in chapel or in the literary societies and debating clubs that flourished on campus. Throughout much of the 20th century, with the growth of the humanistic ideal in American colleges, students might have encountered the big questions in the classrooms of professors possessed of a strong sense of pedagogic mission. Teachers like that still exist in this country, but the increasingly dire exigencies of academic professionalization have made them all but extinct at elite universities. Professors at top research institutions are valued exclusively for the quality of their scholarly work; time spent on teaching is time lost. If students want a conversion experience, they’re better off at a liberal arts college.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When elite universities boast that they teach their students how to think, they mean that they teach them the analytic and rhetorical skills necessary for success in law or medicine or science or business. But a humanistic education is supposed to mean something more than that, as universities still dimly feel. So when students get to college, they hear a couple of speeches telling them to ask the big questions, and when they graduate, they hear a couple more speeches telling them to ask the big questions. And in between, they spend four years taking courses that train them to ask the little questions—specialized courses, taught by specialized professors, aimed at specialized students. Although the notion of breadth is implicit in the very idea of a liberal arts education, the admissions process increasingly selects for kids who have already begun to think of themselves in specialized terms—the junior journalist, the budding astronomer, the language prodigy. We are slouching, even at elite schools, toward a glorified form of vocational training.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Indeed, that seems to be exactly what those schools want. There’s a reason elite schools speak of training leaders, not thinkers—holders of power, not its critics. An independent mind is independent of all allegiances, and elite schools, which get a large percentage of their budget from alumni giving, are strongly invested in fostering institutional loyalty. As another friend, a third-generation Yalie, says, the purpose of Yale College is to manufacture Yale alumni. Of course, for the system to work, those alumni need money. At Yale, the long-term drift of students away from majors in the humanities and basic sciences toward more practical ones like computer science and economics has been abetted by administrative indifference. The college career office has little to say to students not interested in law, medicine, or business, and elite universities are not going to do anything to discourage the large percentage of their graduates who take their degrees to Wall Street. In fact, they’re showing them the way. The liberal arts university is becoming the corporate university, its center of gravity shifting to technical fields where scholarly expertise can be parlayed into lucrative business opportunities.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It’s no wonder that the few students who are passionate about ideas find themselves feeling isolated and confused. I was talking with one of them last year about his interest in the German Romantic idea of bildung, the upbuilding of the soul. But, he said—he was a senior at the time—it’s hard to build your soul when everyone around you is trying to sell theirs.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Yet there is a dimension of the intellectual life that lies above the passion for ideas, though so thoroughly has our culture been sanitized of it that it is hardly surprising if it was beyond the reach of even my most alert students. Since the idea of the intellectual emerged in the 18th century, it has had, at its core, a commitment to social transformation. Being an intellectual means thinking your way toward a vision of the good society and then trying to realize that vision by speaking truth to power. It means going into spiritual exile. It means foreswearing your allegiance, in lonely freedom, to God, to country, and to Yale. It takes more than just intellect; it takes imagination and courage. “I am not afraid to make a mistake,” Stephen Dedalus says, “even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake, and perhaps as long as eternity, too.”  
...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The world that produced John Kerry and George Bush is indeed giving us our next generation of leaders. The kid who’s loading up on AP courses junior year or editing three campus publications while double-majoring, the kid whom everyone wants at their college or law school but no one wants in their classroom, the kid who doesn’t have a minute to breathe, let alone think, will soon be running a corporation or an institution or a government. She will have many achievements but little experience, great success but no vision. The disadvantage of an elite education is that it’s given us the elite we have, and the elite we’re going to have."  
--William Deresiewicz

"We have a crisis of leadership in America because our overwhelming power and wealth, earned under earlier generations of leaders, made us complacent, and for too long we have been training leaders who only know how to keep the routine going. Who can answer questions, but don’t know how to ask them. Who can fulfill goals, but don’t know how to set them. Who think about how to get things done, but not whether they’re worth doing in the first place. What we have now are the greatest technocrats the world has ever seen, people who have been trained to be incredibly good at one specific thing, but who have no interest in anything beyond their area of expertise. What we don’t have are leaders.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What we don’t have, in other words, are thinkers. People who can think for themselves. People who can formulate a new direction: for the country, for a corporation or a college, for the Army—a new way of doing things, a new way of looking at things. People, in other words, with *vision*.  
...  
[T]rue leadership means being able to think for yourself and act on your convictions.  
...  
*Thinking means concentrating on one thing long enough to develop an idea about it.* Not learning other people’s ideas, or memorizing a body of information, however much those may sometimes be useful. Developing your own ideas. In short, thinking for yourself....  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. It’s only by concentrating, sticking to the question, being patient, letting all the parts of my mind come into play, that I arrive at an original idea. By giving my brain a chance to make associations, draw connections, take me by surprise. And often even that idea doesn’t turn out to be very good. I need time to think about it, too, to make mistakes and recognize them, to make false starts and correct them, to outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and move on to the next thing.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I used to have students who bragged to me about how fast they wrote their papers. I would tell them that the great German novelist Thomas Mann said that a writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people. The best writers write much more slowly than everyone else, and the better they are, the slower they write. James Joyce wrote *Ulysses*, the greatest novel of the 20th century, at the rate of about a hundred words a day—half the length of the selection I read you earlier from *Heart of Darkness*—for seven years. T.S. Eliot, one of the greatest poets our country has ever produced, wrote about 150 pages of poetry over the course of his entire 25-year career. That’s half a page a month. So it is with any other form of thought. You do your best thinking by slowing down and concentrating.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;...Think about what the word [concentrating] means. It means gathering yourself together into a single point rather than letting yourself be dispersed everywhere into a cloud of electronic and social input. It seems to me that Facebook and Twitter and YouTube—and just so you don’t think this is a generational thing, TV and radio and magazines and even newspapers, too—are all ultimately just an elaborate excuse to run away from yourself. To avoid the difficult and troubling questions that being human throws in your way. Am I doing the right thing with my life? Do I believe the things I was taught as a child? What do the words I live by—words like *duty, honor, and country*—really mean? Am I happy?  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;...Unless you know who you are, how will you figure out what you want to do with the rest of your life? Unless you’re able to listen to yourself, to that quiet voice inside that tells you what you really care about, what you really believe in—indeed, how those things might be evolving under the pressure of your experiences....  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;...The very rigor and regimentation to which you are quite properly subject here [at West Point] naturally has a tendency to make you lose touch with the passion that brought you here in the first place. I saw exactly the same kind of thing at Yale. It’s not that my students were robots. Quite the reverse. They were intensely idealistic, but the overwhelming weight of their practical responsibilities, all of those hoops they had to jump through, often made them lose sight of what those ideals were. Why they were doing it all in the first place.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So it’s perfectly natural to have doubts, or questions, or even just difficulties. The question is, what do you do with them? Do you suppress them, do you distract yourself from them, do you pretend they don’t exist? Or do you confront them directly, honestly, courageously? If you decide to do so, you will find that the answers to these dilemmas are not to be found on Twitter or Comedy Central or even in The New York Times. They can only be found within—without distractions, without peer pressure, in solitude.  
...  
'She had given me a chance to come out a bit—to find out what I could do. No, I don’t like work. I had rather laze about and think of all the fine things that can be done. I don’t like work—no man does—but I like what is in the work,—the chance to find yourself. Your own reality—for yourself, not for others—what no other man can ever know.' [--Joseph Conrad, *Heart of Darkness*]  
...  
Thinking for yourself means finding yourself, finding your own reality. Here’s the other problem with Facebook and Twitter and even The New York Times. When you expose yourself to those things, especially in the constant way that people do now—older people as well as younger people—you are continuously bombarding yourself with a stream of other people’s thoughts. You are marinating yourself in the conventional wisdom. In other people’s reality: for others, not for yourself. You are creating a cacophony in which it is impossible to hear your own voice, whether it’s yourself you’re thinking about or anything else...Leadership means finding a new direction, not simply putting yourself at the front of the herd that’s heading toward the cliff.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So why is reading books any better than reading tweets or wall posts? Well, sometimes it isn’t. Sometimes, you need to put down your book, if only to think about what you’re reading, what you think about what you’re reading. But a book has two advantages over a tweet. First, the person who wrote it thought about it a lot more carefully. The book is the result of his solitude, his attempt to think for himself.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Second, most books are old. This is not a disadvantage: this is precisely what makes them valuable. They stand against the conventional wisdom of today simply because they’re not from today. Even if they merely reflect the conventional wisdom of their own day, they say something different from what you hear all the time. But the great books, the ones you find on a syllabus, the ones people have continued to read, don’t reflect the conventional wisdom of their day. They say things that have the permanent power to disrupt our habits of thought. They were revolutionary in their own time, and they are still revolutionary today.  
...  
Introspection means talking to yourself, and one of the best ways of talking to yourself is by talking to another person. One other person you can trust, one other person to whom you can unfold your soul.
This is what we call thinking out loud, discovering what you believe in the course of articulating it.

"So there was a kid back in February from, ah, Baltimore--ah, 14 years old [Jack Andraka]--who, ah, had access to Jstor. And he'd been spelunking through Jstor after reading something, and he figured out a way to do early tests for pancreatic cancer [by infusing a conductive carbon mesh with a chemical that bonds to a biomarker from blood of a testee, thereby changing the conductivity of the material]. And pancreatic cancer kills the shit out of you because we detect it way too late: By the time we detect it, it's already too late to do anything about it. Ah, and, um, He sent emails off to the entire oncology department at Johns Hopkins, you know, hundreds of them .. and most of them ignored it, right. But one of them, like, sent him an email back and said 'This is not an entirely stupid idea. Why don't you come on over.' And this kid worked evenings and weekends with this researcher, and in February I heard him on the news, just a couple of weeks after Aaron died, when Aaron was in the news a lot. [*pauses and tears up*] Sorry [*breathes*] And, ah, he said, um, the reason he was on the news is cause they'd done it; they were shipping, ah, an early test for pancreatic cancer that was gonna save lives. And he said, ah, this is why what Aaron did was so important: Because you never know, right? This truth of the universe is not only something [*wipes tear*] that policy makers use to figure out, you know, what the speed limit should be; it's where the, the thing that's gonna keep, you know, your kid from dying of pancreatic cancer comes from.

"[I]f some direction or meaning could be given to our actions, great human forces would be unleashed. So, very many answers have been given to the question of the meaning of it all. But the answers have been of all different sorts, and the proponents of one answer have looked with horror at the actions of the believers in another. Horror, because from a disagreeing point of view, all the great potentialities of the race are channeled into a false and confining blind alley. In fact, it is from the history of the enormous monstrosities created by false belief that philosophers have realized the apparently infinite and wondrous capacities of human beings. ...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What, then, is the meaning of it all? ... I think that we must frankly admit that *we do not know*. But, in admitting this, we have probably found the open channel.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is not a new idea; this is the idea of the Age of Reason. This is the philosophy that guided the men who made the democracy that we live under. The idea that no one really knew how to run a government led to the idea that we should arrange a system by which new ideas could be developed, tried out, and tossed out if necessary, with more new ideas brought in, a trial-and-error system.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This method was a result of the fact that science was already showing itself to be a succesful venture at the end of the 18th century. Even then it was clear to socially-minded people that the openness of possibilities was an opportunity, and that doubt and discussion were essential to progress into the unknown. If we want to solve a problem that we have never solved before, we must leave the door to the unknown ajar."

"Woe to him who saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point in carrying on. He was soon lost. The typical reply with which such a man rejected all encouraging arguments was, 'I have nothing to expect from life any more.' What sort of answer can one give to that?  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that *it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.* We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life--daily and hourly.

We just want our Systems to work as smoothly in real life as they did in our fantasies."  
--John Gall

"When Reframing is complete, the Problem is not 'solved'--it doesn't even exist any more. There is no longer any Problem to discuss, let alone a Solution [(which may cause its own consequences and problems)]. [Or, the Problem can be transformed to something more tractable.] In the fleeting moment of transition from the old Model to the New [(Paradigm Shift)], one has a brief opportunity to realize consciously what most of us seldom think about, namely, that labels such as ['crime', 'oppressor', 'socialism', etc.] are *artefacts of terminology*, not permanent attributes of the Universe or of Human Nature. With that awareness we are no longer locked into models that offer no solution. We are free to seek out ever more appropriate Models of the Universe."

"...the necessity of a New Breed of Systems-student--one who, having absorbed the Axioms here collected and, more importantly, the *spirit* infusing them, can progress beyond technology to the kind of wisdom the world needs. The world already suffers from too many experts. They tell us more than we need to know or dare to ask about ingenious machines, fusion bombs, and management science. What we really need to know is much more subtle.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We need to know if setting up Management by Objectives in the Universities will bring on another Dark Age; if placing a microphone in the Oval Office can bring down the government; if permitting men and women everywhere the freedom to choose their own way of life and to make their own decisions can lead to a better world. For such questions your run-of-the-mill expert is of little value. What is required is a special, elusive talent, really an intuition--a feel for the wild, weird, wonderful, and paradoxical ways of Large Systems. We offer no formula for recognizing or cultivating such a talent. But we suggest that its possessor will, more likely than not, have cut his/her eyeteeth on the Axioms of General Systemantics."

"Systems are seductive. They promise to do a hard job faster, better, and more easily than you could do it yourself. But if you set up a System, you are likely to find your time and effort now being consumed in the care and feeding of the System itself. New Problems are created by its very presence (Fundamental Theorem). Once set up, it won't Go Away; it Grows and Encroaches (Laws of Growth). It begins to do Strange and Wonderful Things (Generalized Uncertainty Principle) and Breaks Down in Ways You Never Thought Possible (Fundamental Failure Theorem). It Kicks Back, Gets In The Way and Opposes Its Own Proper Function (Le Chatelier's Principle). Your own perspective becomes distorted by being In The System (Functionary's Fault). You become anxious and Push On It To Make It Work (Administrator's Anxiety). Eventually you come to believe that the misbegotten product it so grudgingly delivers is What You Really Wanted all the time (Systems-delusion). At that point, Encroachment has become complete. You have become absorbed. You are now a Systems-person."  
--John Gall

"Go with the flow. In human terms, this means working *with* human tendencies rather than against them. For example, a State-run lottery flourishes even in times of economic depression because its function is aligned with the basic human instinct to gamble a small stake in hopes of a large reward. The Public School System, on the other hand, although founded with the highest and most altruistic goals in mind, remains in a state of chronic failure because it violates the principle of spontaneity in human learning. It goes against the grain and therefore it does not ever really succeed. It has made literacy universal, but not truly popular."

"[O]ne of the defining characteristics of true transformation is self redefinition. ... Indeed, rather than be swept away by life and force of habit, the individual can seize control of their life. They can fight against 'inevitability' and the idea of settling for whatever life hands them. We are either compliant with our seemingly preordained fate or we fight. We who choose to embrace the fight understand that life itself is a struggle and \[welcome\] it. Compliant living is mere existing. We want more--we want to improve our quality of life by methodically engaging in our parallel disciplines. Over time our practices will transform us."

"Common sense tells us that consciously thinking about a problem or deliberating about the options is the best strategy for making a decision. Consider the possibility that *not* consciously thinking can produce an outcome superior to that of consciously thinking. In a study be Ap Dijksterhuis (2004), participants evaluated complex information regarding real-world choices. One situation involved selecting an apartment. In each case, the participants chose between alternatives that had negative features (e.g., high rent, bad location) and positive features (e.g., nice landlord, good view). Objectively, one apartment was the best choice. Some participants were required to make an immediate choice (no thought). Some had to think for 3 minutes and then choose (conscious thought). Others had to work for 3 minues on a difficult, distracting task and then choose (unconscious thought). Across three separate trials, those in the unconscious thought condition made the best decisions. According to Dijksterhuis and Nordgren (2006), unconscious processing is especially valuable for complex decisions in which it is difficult to weigh the pros and cons consciously. Perhaps this is why, for very important decisions, people often choose to "sleep on it.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Consider also the possibility that consciously thinking can undermine good decision making. The social psychologist Tim Wilson and the cognitive psychologist Jonathan Schooler (1991) asked research participants to rate james. When the participants simply tasted the james, their ratings were very similar to experts' ratings. However, whent he participants had to explain their ratings jam by jam, their ratings differed substantially from the experts'. Unless the experts were wrong, the participants had made poorer judgements: Having to reflect consciously about their reasons apparently altered their perceptions of the jams."

"I think the simplest and most pragmatic way of understanding it [enlightenment] ... the most down-to-earth way of understanding it, rather than as some great mystical experience, is 'the mind free, free of those patterns and tendencies that cause suffering', like, in traditional Buddhism, of greed and hatred and delusion [the "defilements", the opposite of wisdom]. So we could say enlightenment is the mind free of those forces. Now this can be interpreted in two ways ... : It can be be interpreted in terms of: These forces are actually uprooted so that they don't arise again. And this is a very classical view of the path of enlightenment, that they're progressively weakened and finally uprooted from the mindstream. Another way of viewing it, which many teachers and traditions do, is not so much with the understanding that they're uprooted, but rather in the moment of their arising they're seen through, so we're not caught by them in any way. In both cases the mind is free. I have a slight bias toward one of these views [laughing], but I take a somewhat agnostic position in terms of the ultimate truth of one over the other."  
--Joseph Goldstein, *Making Sense* #63

Joseph Goldstein: "We do want to develop the wholesome states of love and kindness and mindfulness and concentration, but not as an end in themselves, and to see the development of them as being supportive for dropping back from craving, letting go of the wanting mind."
Sam Harris: "So if, in the Buddhist framework, transcending desire, transcending craving, transcending wanting is in some sense the goal, or at least the inescapable sign of progress, how does that square with any kind of positive aspiration to make change in the world? Why isn't that the lazy man's out with respect to shouldering any kind of important responsibility in life, and why isn't that just a counsel of apathy in the face of real-world problems?"
Goldstein: "...I think a useful distinction to make is that between aspiration and expectation. Aspiration sets a direction, so that we're heading in a certain direction, whether it's of awakening or of more compassionate engagement with the world. ... Expectation is more when we bring this wanting mind, wanting or expecting things to be a certain way when we want them, forgetting that everything is arising out of causes and conditions, and that we need to understand the conditions necessary to bring about a desired result. There's a very important balance&mdash;and they're mutually supportive in perhaps a non-obvious way&mdash;between equanimity and compassion. Equanimity is that spaciousness of mind that can hold whatever is arising, and we see it clearly whether it's within ourselves or in the world. We see what the situation is without reactivity. So we could say that that's the mind of not wanting, of not craving. It's the mind-like space that holds everything, but within that space there's discernment. We can really see what's skillful, what's unskillful, what creates suffering, what leads to the diminishment of suffering. And in that discernment, then there's the possibility of compassion arising, wanting to alleviate the suffering. But it's not from a place of clinging; it's not from a place of greed. One of the problems is that sometimes the words we use in English to describe our experience of the process, some words have multiple meanings, like 'wanting' or 'desire'. So wanting could be the wanting of greed or holding or clinging to something, or it could be the wanting or desire of aspiration. ... So we might use the word desire, but it's a very different mind-state ..."

Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place ... Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you.

Seize that moment. That moment is a crossroads where everything you want will collide with everything standing in your way. You've got momentum at your back. Fear and doubt are thundering like a freight train straight at you.

"Over the years, I've come to see that one of the most pernicious issues couples struggle with is working through wrongdoing and blame. The claim 'You hurt me' often sends couples spiraling. People want to feel like good and lovable beings; their intentions make perfect sense to themselves, and they hate being interpreted as selfish. In psychoanalytic jargon we often say 'No one likes being the "bad object".' In fact, there are few things people resist more than being held responsible for causing harm. It immediately threatens to overwhelm the 'offender' with shame (Am I a bad person?) and guilt (Have I cause irreparable damage? Should I be punished?). Yet serious hurt that goes unacknowledged leads to the accumulation of resentment and a deadening of the relationship."

Cam: "And then, yeah, how do you answer? 'Hangin' in there.'"  
Donna: "That's right."  
Cam: "'Cause to answer honestly, you'd have to talk incessantly for days, and who wants to listen to that, right? So... How are you doing?"  
Donna: [Chuckles] "Hangin' in there."  
Cam: "I lost a really good friend. And I don't have that many of those to spare. I know, like, poor me. But I've always had a bit of trouble making those sorts of connections." [Shuddered breathing] "There's just not a lot of people in my life."

"We live in an age of exponential growth in knowledge, and it is increasingly futile to teach only polished theorems and proofs. We must abandon the guided tour through the art gallery of mathematics, and instead teach how to create mathematics we need. In my opinion, there is no long-term practical alternative."

"I wanted to be honest with you and show you how easy, if you will follow Pasteur's rule that 'luck favors the prepared mind', it is to succeed by merely preparing yourself too succeed. Yes, there were elements of luck in the discovery; but there were many other people in much the same situation, and they did not do it! Why me? Luck, to be sure, but also I was preparing myself by trying to understand what was going on--more than the other people around, who were merely reacting to things as they happened, and not thinking deeply as to what was behind the surface phenomena.  
...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Of course, as you go through life you do not know what you are preparing yourself for--only you want to do significant things and not spend the whole of your life being a 'janitor of science', or whatever your profession is. Of course luck plays a prominent role. But so far as I can see, life presents you with many, many opportunities for doing great things (define them as you will), and the prepared person usually hits one or more successes"  
--Richard Hamming, *The Art of Doing Science and Engineering*, on his discovery of Error-Correcting Codes

"You establish yourself in the style of doing great things, and then when opportunity comes you almost automatically respond with greatness ... [T]he possibility of greatness is more common and easy to achieve than you think, since it is not common to recognize greatness when it happens under one's nose ...

"...whether the effort required for excellence is worth it. I believe it is--the chief gain is in the effort to change yourself, in the struggle with yourself, and it is less in the winning than you might expect. Yes, it is nice to end up where you wanted to be, but the person you are when you get there is far more important. I believe a life in which you do not try to extend yourself regularly is not worth living--but it is up to you to pick the goals you believe are worth striving for."

"The next time something happens in your life that makes you angry or afraid or sad, how long will you spend locked in the prison of one of those emotions? And what will you do there? What indelible mark might you make in your life or in our world on the basis of one of those emotions?"  
--Sam Harris

"You're making yourself based on what you're doing with your attention and the kinds of habits you're ramifying. And you are, quite literally, sculpting your neural circuitry in the mean time...All of these moments matter, and they deliver to you your future self who will have whatever competencies or weaknesses or mounting dissatisfaction with life to deal with. And if your life doesn't feel the way you want it to feel, there's a lot you have done on purpose and by accident to bring yourself to this point, and there's a lot you may yet do to feel differently."

"You have to figure out what it is you're doing with your attention moment-to-moment that's denying you access to the reality you just saw a mere two hours ago."

"This ability to begin again has ethical force as well. It's actually the foundation of forgiveness. The only way to truly forgive another person--or one's self--is to restart the clock in the present. And this habit of mind allows for a resilience that we can't otherwise find. ... There's no real reason why the next 10 minutes in the gym can't be the best you've had in years. There's no real reason why you can't put this conversation, that's almost over, on a new footing by saying something that is truly useful. So the practice is to stop telling ourselves a story about what has been happening and fully connect with experience in this moment."  
--Sam Harris

"What begins to happen is that your own psychological suffering becomes a kind of mindfulness alarm, which reminds you to pay attention. And when you pay attention, it actually helps. That's the sign that your mindfulness is becoming a useful skill. And in those moments, you no longer imagine that your suffering is coming from the outside. You're no longer disposed to merely blame the world or other people. You realize, viscerally, that that thing that made you angry or anxious wasn't the true cause of your suffering. The true cause was internal to your mind. And you can take responsibility for noticing this process and for relaxing the apparent hold it has on you."  
--Sam Harris

"When you look at the things psychologically that cause you to be a dick, that cause you to act out, that cause you to, let's say, if you feel angry, to helplessly express your anger in relationship, no matter how inappropriate. What that is is a fundamental lack of mindfulness. In the worst case you're not even aware of becoming angry until the words fly out of your mouth, and there's no possibility of being otherwise. You see no choice. There's no pause to take because this thing broke over you like a wave, and everything got wet. ... [This] gives you two categories of experience: You can be angry and totally lost in it, or you can be aware of anger as kind of an energy state of your body, or an arising emotion, which you then can either act out or be motivated to act by, or you can observe as just a change in your person. And the observing mode is different and leads to different consequences. It leads you to pause before saying something. But as you get better and better at that, what you begin to notice is that all of these negative emotions have a very short half-life. It's impossible to actually stay angry for any significant amount of time, much less be motivated to derange your life or relationships on its basis, without continually being lost in thought about why you should be angry, or why you have every right to be angry. You have to stay lost in thought. You literally have to be thinking without knowing that you're thinking. ... Is it worth being angry here? Is there some ethical purpose served by expressing anger? Or is this just needless?"  
--Sam Harris, appearance with Andrew Huberman?

"What remains emotionally and attitudinally when you're no longer taken in by thought to the usual degree, and more and more as you break that spell more and more, seems to be exactly the prosocial emotions you would want in a wise and enlightened person. It's not like you become totally without affect, totally without connection to other people. And you can sort of understand why this would be the case, because the inward-turning construction of self, the self-absorption, the concern about what others think about us, the endless judging of people, the continuous capture with our own opinion-making and rumination--when you look at what that's doing to you ethically and emotionally and in relationship, it's a kind of running failure of relationship. It's a failure to actually have sufficient free attention to merely pay attention to others and to actually recognize that you love them, that you care about them, that you want them to be happy. ... When you're speaking to another person, and you're having a face-to-face conversation, so they're looking in to your eyes, and you're looking in to theirs, what prevents that from being...something like the beatific vision? ... Your neurotic concern about how you're perceived, your judgement of them, all of this is mediated by thought of one form or another, and there's a kind of collapse of attention, where you're behind your face, looking at the other and feeling looked at. You become an object in the world for others, and there's that Sartre-ian moment where he decribes this transition-- ... He talked about the condition of a voyeur looking at the object of his lust from outside her window, and the primal circumstance is for that mere subject looking at another to suddenly hear someone stepping up behind him. In that moment, the collapse of recognition that you are an object in the world for others, that contraction--it is a contraction. It is a kind of knot that gets magically tied, seemingly in the center of experience, and so much of our seeking to feel better in life is an attempt to relax that knot. And our peak experiences, when we have them, sexually, athletically, aesthetically, the moments when we get out of ourselves, when there's no distance between ourselves and experience, or ourselves and another person, it's a moment where suddenly we seem to no longer feel that cramp of separateness. ... So what remains when you can actually break this spell is not this cold detachment, necessarily. The mind becomes a kind of wellspring of compassion and freedom from inwardness. Like when you're looking at a sunset, not only can you really look at it without any kind of splitting of your attention; there's *only* the sunset. You're so fully looking at it that you're no longer telling yourself the story of how beautiful the sunset is. [\[Psychological\] fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy) is the wrong concept [for this], because it's just a non-separation. You're no longer breaking yourself off and <a class="page-scroll" href="#Mezinger">constructing yourself in opposition to the world.</a> And so it is with other people: You can recognize that when you give your full attention to the other person, and none of your energy is being spent in being concerned about how they perceive you, it's just a much deeper experience of connection."  
--Sam Harris, #295

"If you are suffering, you are lost in thought. And until you learn a practice like mindfulness, there is no alternative. You live at the whim of the next sentence or image that appears in your mind. ... So when you're suffering, just notice the present thought. Where is it? What is it? What happens to it when you pay attention? And how is it that your suffering can continue in the next moment when the present thought has disappeared?"  
--Sam Harris

"The fact that a thought has arisen does not give it a necessary claim upon your life. It need not have any implications."  
--Sam Harris

"Without having had certain experiences, you really have no sense of how limited your normal experience is. This is in terms of affect and cognition and the ethical implications of both. You just don't know how confined the prison of your mind is, or even that it is a prison, until one of the walls has been broken down for you, and you've seen some vast horizon that you didn't even imagine existed--or even if you did, even if you paid lip service to the possibility, you just didn't know what it would be like to confront it."  
--Sam Harris, #209

"Clearly the burden is on us to figure out how to spread the wealth around and to reconcieve of what it means to be a productive member of society and how people get the self esteem needs and the belonging needs and the connection needs met in a context of those new norms. Where when someone says 'Oh, what are you doing with your life?', now the self esteem module in the average Ivy League brain, it returns the string 'Oh, I'm a junior at Harvard.', and that's answer enough. That's the perfect answer. And then a few years later it will be 'I just got a job at Goldman Sachs.' or Google, and that's the perfect answer. But at a certain point that answer isn't enough, and people can realize it isn't enough even now when they take an inventory of their moment-to-moment experience."

"The image that I love that I often reference from the Dzogchen teachings is that ultimately thoughts are like thieves entering an empty house; there's nothing for them to steal."  
--Sam Harris, #209 (on mindfulness and identifying with thought)

Harris: "[A]t every moment in your life you are practicing something; you're using your atttention in a certain way. And for the most part, if you're like most people, you're using it in ways that lead to predictable sorts of dissatisfaction. You're practicing a kind of meditation on all the things you want, all the things that make you anxious, and a kind of perpetual distraction for which a method like mindfulness is put forward as an antidote. But, as your mind is your life becomes, and so you're engraining various tendencies and habits and neurophysiological states moment by moment, every moment of your life."  
Davidson: "One of the things I frequently say is that neuroplasticity occurs wittingly or unwittingly; most of the time it's occurring unwittingly. Most of the time we're being shaped by forces around us about which we have little insight and little control. And the invitation in this work is that we can actually more intentionally take responsibility for our own minds and brains by cultivating healthier habits of mind."  
Goleman: "...things are changing in a direction I think people may feel a little helpless about. But meditation, or cultivating the ability to concentrate and ignore distractions, I think has a special cachet and virtue now that wasn't true in the past, if only as an antidote to a social trend. There was research at Harvard, that famous paper in Science where they monitored how distracted people are during the day, and the title was 'A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind', because the more your mind wanders in distraction, the more depressed you get."  
Harris: "There really is a different conception of mental health here that we are tacitly endorsing [strength?] ... Most people don't even know that their minds are continuously lost in thought ... Then when you enter a contemplative tradition, and in particular a discussion of mental training in the Buddhist tradition, you see, really as almost your first claim, that this is absolutely pathological, to have your attention continually buffeted by the winds of discursive thought, and you're helplessly carried away by every single thought that enters consciousness. And not only are you carried away by the emotions that it invokes--desire and fear and boredom and all the rest--, you are identified with it such that it seems to be you. Your sense of self is bound up in the flow of thought in a way that most people, it's never occurred to them to question. ..."  
Davidson: "... attentional distraction, mind wandering, as well as reification of the self, believing the thoughts that we have about ourselves as a true depiction of reality, considering them to be true--That you see in depressed people, for example. One of the characteristics of depression is that negative self-thoughts are actually taken to be a veridical description of who the individual is. ... This whole idea we call experiential fusion, where you have the experience of being completely fused with the thought, rather than having a quality of meta-awareness, which is knowing that there is actually a thought occurring and being able to see it as a thought.--And that's something that of course we know can be taught through the kinds of contemplative practices that we're considering.--And one of the most important findings really is the finding that meta-awareness can be strengthened...recognizing that a thought is a thought rather than being swept up in its content."  
Goleman: "One of the main principles of cognitive therapy is that you don't have to believe your thoughts. That's a very revolutionary idea for most of us."  
--Sam Harris, Richie Davidson, Danny Goleman #111

"It was worse than an illusion; it was a half-truth. Right? So it's very hard to debunk a half-truth, 'cause you're always in touch with the half that's true."

"As our first world societies increasingly secularize, and religion comes under the shadow and pressure of that, and there seem to be more zero-sum contests between scientific rationality and any policy that would be spun up on its basis [versus] religious dogmatism, you get this grinding of the gears of tradition and society. And I do think in America, for a long time, the so-called elite institutions have represented either an explicit or a tacit disavowal of some people's---many people's---most cherished beliefs, and that becomes at minimum a kind of lubricant for a kind of anti-institutional focus."  
--Sam Harris, #441 (I'd point out it's a source of anti-intellectualism too.)

"There are those who will say terrible things about JavaScript. Many of these things are true. When I was required to write something in JavaScript for the first time, I quickly came to despise it. It would accept almost anything I typed but interpret it in a way that was completely different from what I meant. This had a lot to do with the fact that I did not have a clue what I was doing, of course, but there is a real issue here: JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it allows. The idea behind this design was that it would make programming in JavaScript easier for beginners. In actuality, it mostly makes finding problems in your programs harder because the system will not point them out to you."

"There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health.

It's not rocket science."

"I read an article when I was very young in Scientific American, and it, um, it measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. So for, you know, bears and chimpanzees and raccoons and birds and fish. How many kilocalories per kilometer did they spend to move? And, and humans were measured too. And, ah, the condor won; it was the most efficient. And mankind, the crown of creation, came in with a rather unimpressive showing about a third of the way down the list. Um, but somebody there had the brilliance to test a human riding a bicycle. *smiles* Blew away the condor--all the way off the charts! And I remember this really had an impact on me. I really remember this: that humans are tool-builders, and we build tools that can dramatically amplify our innate human abilities. And to me [the computer represents the ultimate tool.]--We actually ran an ad like this very early at Apple, that the personal computer was the bicycle of the mind. And I believe that with every bone in my body, that of all the inventions of humans the computer is going to rank near if not at the top as history unfolds and we look back."

"In the biggest picture, aside from psychadelics' ability to treat one disorder or another, I think they're just poised to really help us to understand the nature of psychiatric disorders. What commonalities do they have with each other that are somehow being addressed by psychadelic treatment? I kind of think of all of these disorders as different forms of addiction. So whether it's to a substance like tobacco, or alcohol, cocaine, or a way of thinking about yourself, it's this narrowed mental and behavioral repertoire. Reality used to be like this [arms wide], and now your reality is like this [narrows hands together]. And psychadelics, when done well in the right setting, have the ability to just blow people out of that narrowed story."

"It must have been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were required to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6 p.m. curfew. I had gone to play with a Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others, the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting."

"There are actually different types of self-actualizing people. There are self-actualizers who are perfectly content going their entire lives realizing their own potential...but they really don't care much about maximizing the potential of others. There's not a great connection between self and others. They may dazzle with their talents, or at work they may be doing good work, and they feel self-actualized. But they're not what Maslow called the transcenders. He argued that transcenders were a different kind of self-actualizers who were consistently motivated by higher values. He called them the 'be values', the values of being itself, things where there's no means to an end; they're ends in themselves, like the search for beauty, the search for justice, for meaningfulness in the world, for goodness. And you're motivated by these values, but also you're motivated by peak experiences in life."  
Harris: "...there's more needed in the toolkit for living a truly examined life and becoming a better person than just having certain self-transcending experiences. Certainly I think the 'peak experience' is the wrong model. Whatever the peak is, it comes; it goes; it's not the ultimate insight in to the nature of your consciousness that will transform you. ... What's needed is an actual conscious integration with ethics."  
"...I think it's really important to not treat these practices as panaceas, as quick fixes. Maslow called them 'quick hits of transcendence'; he was very much against that. He thought self-actualization took a lot of work. ... He really viewed self-actualization as being committed to a calling or something deep within yourself that you love that brings out the best in you, and that you are committed to working towards day in and day out. He very much was in that sort of meaning mode, similar to Viktor Frankl."

"You can live your life with a fear of uncertainty: In a sort of linear way, the greater the fear, the more we go in to this state psychologists have identified, psychological entropy, where we, at the ultimate extreme, we just can't cope, and we get depression; we feel helpless. Or you can live in a constant state of exploration. And exploration means that you are actively exploring the unknown. The unknown excites you. The unknown entices you. The more you can master and challenge the unknown, the happier you are in your life. ... You have to constantly choose the exploration option and learn how to manage the uncertainty that's inevitable in your life. ... Are you really going to live that life with a spirit of exploration and openness to new experiences and curiosity for the unknown, or are you committed to fearing it and having that illusion of control?"

"I teach a course at Columbia called The Science of Living Well ... Most of these students have been living on autopilot thinking 'Oh, the piont is to get a good GPA so that I have a good resume to get in to a good--' It's always about the future. It's always about some objective metric that everyone can agree on as 'Now you're worth it. Now you're worthy.' In this course I teach I have growth as the metric, and that's it. So there isn't comparison from one person to another. I have a whole series of growth challenges throughout the semester. Maybe it could be confronting and embracing your dark side and really becoming friends with it. Another growth challenge is increasing the high quality connections in your life, or being more mindful of things around you and having more gratitude in your life. And you start to add up all these things, and students start to realize that _that's_ life, like those are the things. There's actually nothing more to life. That's it!  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;... Really, the plateau experience, that's the most profound, transcendent moments of your life, where you can find the miraculous in the everyday. _That's_ life. If you can cultivate that skill, that'll be a far greater skill than constantly beating yourself up over not getting this grade or that grade or this amount of money, or look that other person's getting that amount of money. Life becomes a zero-sum relative game. If you can move towards growth in your momentary experiences in your life and really realize that everything around you is already pretty miraculous, like right now, that's a fundamentally different way of being and living.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;... The insight a lot of these students are getting is that: You may think that there ever will be a point in your life where you get there, and then you've accomplished something, or you've reached self-actualization, or you've reached transcendence. But it's _all_ just a process. It's _all_ just the relational interaction between the experience of you and the world. And that happens in a momentary, momentary basis. And there are just so many things we can do right now without waiting, without waiting for that paycheck or waiting for the next job that can give us meaning."

"I think to realize that you were not only so wrong but so wrong in such a harmful way is a devestating thing to realize, and it's something that it's totally human to want to rebel against at every point. The sunk cost isn't just that they were wrong and that's embarrassing. The sunk cost is that they hurt someone in the process of being wrong. And so it's not just the misinformation, and it's not just the ego of wanting to be right: I think that people are afraid of what it means about them if they were this wrong, and that it's much easier for them to believe that there's something wrong with me to have deserved the harm that I suffered. And so, I think it goes to people identifying with their ideas, and, when put on the spot and even when having plain evidence put in front of them that what they believe is wrong, it feels to them like what you're saying is that they're a bad person. And that's why they can't grasp just the plain, hard, cold facts of it, because it's charged with emotional resonance and with a sense of it implicating them and their identity and who they imagine themselves to be as people."

And for those of us who spend as much time as possible on the heights, our dirty little secret is the hazards are actually part of the appeal.

"...it makes me think about how we use language to understand the world around us. ...[T]he name of a boat is just a word that we've invented to make this world easier to compute in our heads. We separate everything that we can see or experience in to tiny little squares that we can label. And that helps us make predictions and communicate about what's going on and so on. Uh, but the reality isn't like that; the world isn't made up of separate things. It's all just a big mass of gloop. And even if you look at it scientifically, it's very hard to make the distinction between, uh, separate people and objects. As a person I am constantly interacting [with] and part of my environment, both through sight and hearing and breathing and eating and--And at what point does that air or that food, uh, become part of me? And at what point is it part of the environment? And I guess my point here is that by thinking about this we can learn something deeper about our interaction with the world around us. And that is that we can choose to separate things in our minds and consider ourselves as separate from our environment, or we can consider that these labels that we make are not necessarily the ultimate reality of life."

Possession makes one passive, indolent, and proud.

Andrew Sullivan: "...the black/white wealth gap, which is a huge encumbrance to racial equality. And then the question is: How does one get around that? How does one mitigate that? What are the policies that could be constructed to ameliorate that?"  
"Well, I could go down a list. I mean, we could focus on education."  
Andrew: "Well, please do. ..."  
"You know, I wouldn't take it as a goal of public policy to be honest with you. I mean, why the *racial* wealth gap? Why not simply address ourselves, to the extent that we're concerned about the lack of wealth in some quarters in the society, to the lack of wealth? What's race got to do with it? Well we think--I mean, this is a theory of history, isn't it?--We think that the racial wealth gap is a reflection of historical racial disadvantage of one sort or another. And I'm not--And certainly it is to some extent. But I'm not persuaded that that's, as a social scientific claim, the whole story. You know? Wealth doesn't fall from the sky. Wealth is created by human creativity, ingenuity, risk-taking, and entrepreneurship, and all of that. Surely the studies show that there are hangovers from historical discrimination that are reflected in part in asset holding. You can talk about property values and redlining and so on. You can talk about how the housing market works and so on, about inheritance and so on. But it's a very very dynamic system that we're in, and the backward-looking focus on rectification of historical mistreatment I think is the wrong way to look at it. And the racialized focus, I think, is the wrong way to look at it. So I would prefer to talk about what social policies are most effective and consistent with fostering the well-being of all of our people. And I don't say that as an ideological commitment to color-blindness as such; I say it as a moral claim: I don't see that blacks are any more deserving of public attention than whites or asians or latinos or anybody else because our ancestors were not always fairly treated. I say it as a political claim: It seems to me if you wanted to actually *get it done*, whatever the 'it' is, if you wanted a robust system of social supports in terms of healthcare for all of our people, if you wanted early childhood education universally available to families, including those who could not afford it, if you wanted various kinds of regulations of labor market and workplace in terms of family leave or minimum wage or any, *any* of these things, you need political majorities. And the fostering--mustering of those political majorities requires formulatinging your claims in terms that are universally applicable to the people whom you're trying to persuade. But I also say this--what am I saying? What I'm saying is 'Okay, you want to solve a wealth gap. Let's worry about the people who don't have wealth, and let's not worry about what color they are.' I'm also saying that from the point of view, in my opinion, of what is most consistent in the end with the *dignity* and the honor of we African Americans ourselves. Don't make us into clients. Don't make us into wards. Don't make us into a project. *Don't patronize us*. Don't, in this dynamic country that's open to people coming from all over the world--and they're coming in droves, and new lives are being made every year, every generation--, presume we are incapable [of] making of the possibilities that are afforded to us in this great country every bit as much as anyone else who's part of the society."

Andrew Sullivan: "I want to ask a spiritual question of you, because there is a point obviously where you were grappling with addiction, where you, like many people, find the only way out of that addiction is some notion of a higher power saving you in some way and giving up your attempt to control everything with a more spiritual emphasis of letting it go and seeking help from elsewhere. ... But then at some point also you moved away, in fact you have this devastating description of at a friend's funeral you suddenly come to terms with your lack of faith. Can you talk me through that. It's a fascinating dilemma to me."  
"Yeah. Well, it was the late 80s, and I was a cocaine addict, and I had a real serious problem. I had to get help. I was hospitalized. And then spent months at a halfway house as a resident and developed a relationship with the alcoholics anonymous/narcotics anonymous movements and embraced the 12 steps of recovery. You know, I admitted that I was an alcoholic and that my life had become unmanageable. I came to belive that a power greater than myself could restore me to sanity. I made a decision to turn my life over to the will and the care of this power greater than myself. And it wasn't religious at first. It wasn't Christian or anything. It was just one foot in front of the other, one day after the other, trying to claw my way back to a certain dignified way of living. I was miserable, and I was compulsive, and I was my own worst enemy, and if I didn't 'let go and let God' as we would've said, I was gonna destroy myself. I was gonna destroy the people who were close to me, like my wife Linda, my late wife Linda, dependent on me. And I was going to fail to live up to the possibilities of my own humanity. And it was just a waste and a shame, and I didn't know how to solve that problem on my own, and so I surrendered. And through that process, especially the time I spent 5 months living in a halfway house in 1988, I started paying some attention to the promptings of religious people who urged me to consider a relationship with Jesus Christ. I mean, that just puts it directly. And I fell under the influence, and protection really, of a wonderful couple, Ray Hammond and Gloria White Hammond, who are pastors of a church that was just getting started as I was coming along the in the late 1980s, but has prospered as an institution of hope and positive affect in a black community in Boston that still flourishes to this day. And I basically enrolled, my wife and I, this was before our son Glenn, who's now 34 years old, before he was born. And we made ourselves a part of that burgeoning religious community. And I'd say for 15 years I was a stalwart member of the faithful, and we brought our children up in the church, and it had a great positive influence on my life. But I did fall away from it.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And it's a long story, and I will talk about it in the memoir, and I don't want to tell it all here, but I will say that I had a number of different crises--I mean, first of all, I'm an intellectual, you know? I mean, I'm an economist. I'm a PhD. I'm a numbers guy. I'm a rationality guy. So I always had a little bit of kind of second thoughts and doubts in the back of my mind about some of these remarkable claims, like the claim that a man that we call Jesus Christ was raised from the dead and lives even to this day. That's a pretty remarkable thing to belive literally. And there were other things. It was a somewhat charismatic congregation, the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church led by Ray and Gloria Hammond were [an] AME denomination, which is relatively staid and conservative amongst the black protestant denominations. But this particular religious community had a more of a charismatic, pentacostal kind of feel to it. And so they believed things like 'A woman is dying of breast cancer here, but we're praying, and we're extending our hands, and we're calling on the spirit of God to heal her. And we don't doubt that that's a possibility if indeed it be His will.' And there was a lot of expressiveness in worship, you know, a lot of getting happy and dancing and, you know"  
Andrew: "People falling out?"  
"falling out, and speaking in tongues and things of this kind, not, not to excess, not on every occassion. But it was a part of the culture of the church, and I was always, you know, a little uncomfortable with it. There was a performative, it seemed to me, aspect to it. I even tell the story in this book (that will be available before the year is out), I even tell the story of being 'baptized in the Holy Spirit' is what they call it, which is receiving, if you look in the book of Acts in the New Testament, Jesus makes some promises that you can be empowered with these supernatural gifts of healing, of prophecy, of speaking and interpreting tongues, and the rest. 'Ask and ye shall receive. Seek and ye shall find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.' If you petition, if you truly believe, if you call upon the Lord to empower you in this way, you can receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. And one morning when we, the crew that set up the folding chairs in this community school's gymnasium, where the church was meeting, before services, and that took the chairs down after services--And I was a part of this crew. We're doing our labor. After we had finished, the group gathered around for prayer, and it was observed that I had yet to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and they began praying for me to be 'anointed' in this way. And they had hands lain on me, and they were praying, and they were vituperating, and they were expressing, and they were fervent, and they were passionate. And I realized that they weren't gonna stop until something happened. [chuckles] They were just gonna keep on praying."  
Andrew: [chuckles] "And so you gave it to them."  
"I gave it to them, man. And I felt so rotten after the fact, after I'm in my car, and I'm driving home, and I'm 'What am I gonna tell my wife about this thing?' And, you know, so there were little things like--not so little. But the community nevertheless was a wonderful place for us. There was support. There was encouragement. There was decency. I saw people's lives being changed there. I saw people coming from one side to the other there, and it was a good thing, *is* a good thing, in my opinion."  
Andrew: "It's an amazing thing."  
"Right, so to make a long story short, fast-forward maybe 8 or 10 years, and I have a wonderful working relationship with a wonderful young woman who's my administrative assistant who has ambitions to go to law school. She works with me for a few years, does a fantastic job. We raise money to help her take the LSAT prep course, and she gets admitted to Boston University Law School, and she blows it out in the first year and has straight As in her courses and is elected to Law Review and everything. And then suddenly she gets a viral infection of the heart, and she's on a wait list for a heart transplant, and weeks later she's dead. And so she dies, just tragic. So there's a funeral, and at the funeral my congregation, our pastor, the fellow members of the church and family and friends are gathered, and it's a celebration of the fact that she is now with Jesus, that she has been the beneficiary of the promise of ever-lasting life. 'We didn't come to mourn the death of Sherry DuPont; we came here to celebrate the ever-lasting life. God's not dead; he's still alive. Alive! Alive forevermore! Jesus is alive!' And they're *dancing* around this church as they go past the coffin. In the front of the cathedral there's a celebratory mood. People are clapping! And in this moment, I, I was overtaken by a horrible thought, which was that there was nothing righteous about what was going on there at all. Rather, it was *self-righteoous*. We were afraid to confront the realities of our condition, which is that you can step in to an abyss and fall, and it goes all the way down. This promise of ever-lasting life? That was gonna be our salve? We were gonna content ourselves with this *delusion*?--I thought. *I could not suppress the thought*.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I wanted simply, and unselfconsiously to feel the pain and mourn the loss. I wanted to stand in *awe* of it. I didn't want an explanation for it. I didn't want to be placated. I didn't need that. And I found myself thinking, even in that moment, that 'These people are cowards.' And it's a terrible thought. It's a terrible, terrible thought, because they're very, very decent people. They're not bad people at all. But I could not, I could not get rid of the thought. And, you know ... I went home and looked for *Beyond Good and Evil*. I looked for my Nietzsche! I said 'I need to protect myself from these cowardly Christians. They are afraid of life. They are *children*.' And I *could not shake the thought*. And it was the last time that I set foot in a cathedral, *for years*, not until my wife Linda died a decade later, and I found myself bereft and lost and wandering in to a back pew of that very same congregation, where I was received as a prodigal son, but where I had very little to contribute, and I simply wanted to hear the prayers spoken, and I wanted to hear the music sung, and I wanted to be in their company. I did not know why or to what end, but it was almost a decade before I set foot in a church again."  
Andrew: "Nietzsche's critique is, as you put it, this bunch of cowards, this bunch of people who are celebrating weakness and failure and the slave mentality of Christianity, it's by far the most unsettling critique of Christianity I've ever read. And it's interesting you went to him. Because if anyone knows the abyss goes all the way down, it's Nietzsche."

"She has a reception, and my uncle, his sons come to the reception. It's packed with all of these academic types, and these guys from the South Side. They were the only guys from the South Side in there, and it was hilarious, actually, it was hilarious the culture clash that went on. Alfred, my uncle, and Deirdre, the trans woman, are flirting with each other. And Alfred doesn't know what everybody else in the room knows. [laughs] And when I tell him, you should have seen the look on his face. He was *appalled* that he was attracted to this woman. They bring some canapés from the kitchen to serve around as hors d'oeuvres, and he takes one with raw tuna on it, spits it back in his hand, and shouts out 'Y'all got any pork back there?' This is my uncle Alfred. He was a one of a kind character, one of a kind.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So at the end of the day he takes me aside, and he reprimands me. He says 'I listened to your lecture, and I didn't hear any taking-the-white-man-to-task in your whole lecture. You were way too deferential to those people who asked you questions, and you're way too highfalutin academese. And why don't we get down to it? Don't you know we're in a fight to the death here? That black people have ... the man's knee on our neck?' Et cetera. 'I expected more from you.' He says 'We could only send one from our Chicago neighborhoods off the the Harvards and the MITs of the world. We've sent you, and we don't see *us* in anything you do.' ... my response was: I did not abandon the South Side; I transcended it! Everybody comes from somewhere. I've shaken the hands of the president, and I've traveled to a dozen countries around the world, and I've mastered bodies of knowledge, and I've made myself into a world-class practitioner of my craft. That's something that you should be proud of. You shouldn't expect me to mimic *you*. You're trying to put me in a box!  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And in the book when I tell this story, I invoke James Joyce, who makes Stephen Dedalus in *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* say something like, about Irish Nationalism, ... 'When the soul of a man is born in this country, there are nets flung at it to hold him back. I shall try to fly by these nets. You talk to me about language, about religion, about culture. I'm gonna turn those nets into wings and to fly by them.' 'I'm gonna make myself into a man of the modern world', I thought as my uncle was admonishing me. 'I'm not gonna live in your box.' That's what I thought. But I didn't have the courage to tell him that. ... And I'm not sure he would have even understood what I was trying to say to him. I think he would have taken it as impertinent. But I was fighting for the dignity of my life. And by the way, this fellow who had met presidents and had lectured on continents and all the rest, was still a child of the South Side of Chicago, still a *black man*. It was in my cultural, identitarian DNA. You can't take that away from me! Even as I fashion a life as a black man in the 21st century based on the opportunities that have been given, the inspirations I've received and so forth and so on. I'm not less black for being, as it were, a *free* man."  
Andrew Sullivan: "... and they keep trying to recreate the box and put you in it. Now they're trying to recreate gay people and say that we're all queers again, or that we all have the same politics, or that we all have the same notion of what sex is or what life is. ... The more people that speak about their lives honestly as being outside of these boxes, the more oxygen there is in the air for everyone in that community to breathe and flourish. This fear that minorities can't have robust internal debates ... it's a terribly constrictive fear."

"The Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do, who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine is no longer in time, because the malady has become incurable. For it happens in this as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure."  
--Niccolo Machiavelli

"[N]or did that ever please [the Romans] which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time: 'Let us enjoy the benefits of the time', but rather the benefits of their own valor and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good."

"The problem is when we’re on autopilot for so long that we forget we’re on autopilot. Because when we’re not even aware of our own habits, routines, impulses, and reactions, then we no longer control them—--they control us."  
--[Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/self-awareness)

"Our responsibility for ourselves unleashes a deeper fulfillment by allowing us to construe whatever we confront into a value that fulfills our needs. Unruly kids grant us the opportunity to be a good parent and instill discipline and responsibility. A layoff at work grants us the opportunity to experiment with new career paths we had always daydreamed about. A terrible breakup gives us the chance to take an honest look at ourselves and how our behaviors affect our relationships with loved ones.  
...  
We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control a) how we interpret what happens to us, and b) how we respond to what happens to us. Therefore, whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences."

"I liked economics in that, like, I liked..math. Um, I didn't understand that its real-world application, banking, was something very different. You know?...And I was like 'Oh, this is so different from', um, 'how I imagined it when I was in college', you know late at night in the library, like struggling with some proof and being like 'Ahhh! Okay, I'm gonna get my brain to figure this out.' That part of it I loved, but then when I was at a bank, and they're just like 'Here's your cublicle. Here's your computer. Your job is to, like, stay awake as many hours as you can and be accurate, you know, to the third decimal place. Go.' I just, I couldn't understand what was happening in that space, and I couldn't understand why all these, you know, bright, excited young people were finding themselves here. I think I had a moment there where I was just like 'I'm gonna die. And is this what I want to do? Like, day to day.'  
Interviewer: Goldman Sachs was your NDE.  
[Whispers] Oh my God! Yes! I was just thinking to myself 'My therapist would love that.' Like yeah, you're right...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I remember a moment of, I had been there for a period. I was a, a new analyst, but I happened to be staffed on two companies where they were having IPOs at the same time. So the volume of work was crazy. And, I got sick, and, um, there was really no time for that. You know? So you had to just be there anyway. And then I was also just sad. You know, like I would go home from work, and sometimes just cry. And it wasn't just like a few tears; it was the kind of existential crying of like--It was heartbreak. I was heart--I was heartbroken that--Y-you brought this up earlier, the idea of like 'When does a kid lose their imagination? When do they let go of that wild, unbridled thing and become the broken-in horse?' That was the moment for me.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I remember seeing a doctor, telling the doctor that I was having like these waves of sadness, and he was just like 'You're depressed. Here's a prescription for Paxil.' I remember filling the prescription, and it was sitting on my nightstand, and I would come home and be so sad, and I would look at that bottle, and I would think 'Something is wrong here if, like, I'm being told--like I'm doing something that's making me not feel good, and I'm being told that the answer is to just like pop one of these pills.', to make the thing palatable, to just go do the job..And I have so much empathy for that...To numb yourself, bascially. And the doctor's answer, the "System"'s answer was 'Well, there are ways to medicate this so that you don't feel your body's gut reaction.' You just go with what your mind is saying, which is like 'If I do this job, I know exactly how much money I'll be making in two years, how much money I'll make in five years, prolly how much I'll make in ten.'  
Interviewer: Who I'll date, who I'll marry, where I'll live.  
Hundred percent. What are the zip codes? What are the things that I'll have?  
Interviewer: The private school I'll go to, the college I'll bribe.  
[Laughs] And I don't even mean any of that in a dispariaging way, like, I really understand there's such great comfort that comes in being able to feel like you--there's some safety and security in your future, and I don't judge it at all. But for me, in my body I was like reaching a place of, of dysfunction. And I, I couldn't, I couldn't bring myself to take the medication. And that was the moment that I was like..I was just like 'I can't--I have to find a different thing.'...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I was thinking in my rational mind 'I'm on two projects that have IPOs. I should really spend all day Saturday and Sunday at the office.' But then here are my friends, and they want to do this fun thing. And so I took the leap, and we did it. And we got a topic. We didn't sleep for 48 hours; we just made this film over the weekend. It was a total piece of shit, but I had so much fun. And I was like 'Okay, I can work my butt off doing something that I love. And it's dangerous, and I might never make any money, you know, and I may be broke all the time, but I'll be *happy*, I'll be delighted, like--Or I can do this thing that doesn't feel right in my body, where I know there are predictable safe outcomes.' And to me suddenly then it just--It actually wasn't a choice anymore. I just seemed so obvious, like 'I have to go this other way.'  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So it's like suddenly you get rid of the safety net, and you're just like 'I accept that my life is gonna be on a high wire, and I'm gonna put one foot in front of the other every day. And it's gonna be dangerous, and I'm probably--and there's the fear of falling, but I'm gonna just keep going on this thing with no net, believing that it..believing that it will make a more interesting life.', like lived life, and that that will be better than the version where you're just, you're on the ground in the net."

"The more decisive you are, the more predictable you are. What Leibniz said--I think he was correct--he said most people say, the *creature* in his ontology that has the most free will of all is God. Why? Cause God can do whatever. But Leibniz says 'I can predict exactly what God's gonna do: God's gonna pick the best of all possible worlds.' Why? Because he's a moral being, and so he's gonna do the best thing possible. He would never do the worst when the better was available. So the question is 'Does predictability conflict with freedom?' And insofar as the freedom is freedom to do what you desire, and somebody knows what you desire, they can predict what you're gonna do; it doesn't make you less free. They said you're *freer* the more motivated you are."  
Harris: "...The buck stops with what you want, and you didn't create your wants."  
"That's where the buck *should* stop. Why should I have to will what I will? Of course if you demand that I will that will, and then I will that I will that I will, and so on, I'm in an infinite regress, and you've set up a mug's game. But why should I care? I've got my desires. Somebody wants money, and they consider robbing a bank. What are their desires? Their desire is to have money. They think the thing through. They know they don't have to. They consider various alternatives. On the basis of their greed they decide to rob the bank. *That's* they case where we really put 'em in jail, where they're not at all indecisive."

"Who do people say the real King Arthur might have been? Perhaps a Roman officer who served in Britain, or a Romano-British chieftain, or a Welsh king, some senior figure who lived at any point from the 3<sup>rd</sup> to the 6<sup>th</sup> Century (the 200s to the 500s). Someone like that, the idea goes, might have been the bit of real grit in the imagination oyster that turned into the Arthurian pearl. Personally I don't think imagination oysters need real grit any more than metaphorical bonnets need real bees. What caused the Arthur pearl was the persistent longing of humans of almost all eras and cultures to hark back to something better. It's a far more enduring psychological habit than a belief in progress. People found it much easier to believe in a rose-tinted view of the past than a utopian future. They still do. Hence 'take back control' and 'make America great again'. For most of the period covered by this book, any claims or attempts by leaders to change or improve things are most persuasively labeled, to the people of the time, as restorations of some kind. Saying that something was totally new often played badly.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;...There's now been so much talk about King Arthur over the centuries that many people feel, like they do with ghosts, that 'there must be something in it'. There is. It just happens to be deep-seated psychological need rather than historical reality. The story of Arthur reflects our longing as a species for the ancient, concealed, and magical....
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;...To the people of the Middle Ages, he was in modern dress. They imagined him like a contemporary king but less shit, a paragon of justice, might, and legitimacy. He could be whomever and whatever they needed. What he was king of, in the most real sense, is Albion. And what is Albion? It's poetic and ancient connotations go beyond merely being the old name for Britain. It's prettymuch whatever you want it to be: an English Britain, a Welsh Britain, a Scottish Britain, a Celtic Britain, an ancient British Britain, a nice version of here."  
--David Mitchell, *Unruly*, King Arthur chapter

"Notwithstanding the Caratacus and Buttica led resistance to the early days of Roman control, by the time the Empire left the ancient Britons had gone completely Stockholm syndrome.

"...though nobody seemed to be able to draw a face that looked realistic at any point between the Romans leaving and the Tudors. Does thinking that make me a Philistine?

In fact, the monk who drew it shows few signs of having laid eyes on a human being of any sort, though the facial expression he gives Aethelred might have inspired cartoonists of later centuries who were trying to capture the essence of someone who's just been viciously bonked on the head. We find Aethelred sitting on his throne with this look of lopsided bafflement. His right hand is grasping what looks like an enormous inflatable green sword. His left scratches his crotch. One leg is slightly raised, as if to facilitate a fart."  
--David Mitchell

"Aethelred's first wife, Aelfgifu, had recently died, so, in her role as queen of England, Emma was also given the name Aelfgifu. This might have been less confusing for Aethelred, but not for anyone else, then or since, enchantingly beautiful though the name Aelfgifu obviously is."

"In a time of deep and sincere religiosity and terrifyingly short and brutal human existences, the idea that the hand of God was moving in a mysterious way to ensure some sort of cosmic justice, so that when things seemed to go unexpectedly well or badly that wasn't just the terrifying random nature of existence, but a tiny incomprehensible part of some vaguely beneficent plan, was key to keeping everyone's peckers up."

"They also said---and obviously this was a scandalous accusation for the time---that he was gay. They didn't put it like that, of course. People at the time said William indulged in the sin of sodomy and encouraged effeminacy in his followers. They said William did that sin lots, which was very bad of him and meant he was a terrible king who deserved to die young in a hunting accident. We don't know if he was gay or bisexual or if the various forms of sexual abandon that he's accused of actually happened. Maybe it was just that he was mean to the church, and so the chroniclers, all of whom lived in monasteries, accused him of sodomy to sully his reputation. But where would they have got the idea from living in a monastery?"

"The Crusaders were travelling vast distances without any maps worth the name and trying to keep armies fed and watered as they went. Plus the people whom the survivors of the journey had come to fight not only had colossal home advantage, they also hadn't endured the economic and technological knock-back of the dark ages in the way Western Europe had. The Franks, as Western Europeans were often collectively known, were a backward civilization compared to the Islamic states from which they tried to conquer the Holy Land. The fact that the crusaders kind of managed, off and on, to maintain a collection of Christian states near, and occasionally including, Jerusalem is a real testament to how nuts they all were. It's a major example from history of the energizing power of insanity."

"William Marshal was a warrior and a politician, hugely rich and hugely successful...Earlier in his life he'd been on crusade and served both Henry II and Henry the Young King, so it was apt that he ended his career serving Henry the Even Younger King. He was about 70 by the time Henry III became king, which was pretty old even to be alive in those days, so it seems likely that he was fond of the kid. As a supporter of John, he knew what a disaster his son has been born in to and must have looked on this child, wearing a woman's fascinator [John had lost the crown jewels, so they coronated Henry with something of his mother's] and carrying a man's sword amid medieval military turmoil, with a grandfather's fondness. Similarly, the fatherless child, suddenly told that God had appointed him in charge of everything, must have loved the indomitable old man who turned up and cared. Their love conquered all---or England, anyway."

"It's one of the many historical examples of the weird way antisemitism waxes and wanes for no clear reason with little warning and with cataclysmic consequences for Jewish people.

"People on their deathbeds, when contemplating their interview at the pearly gates, will have been thinking 'I'm a bit worried all the wanking will get mentioned, but at least I was consistently horrible to Jews, so that should count in my favor.' Their certainty that they were right is worth remembering, because it means there's probably stuff we're certain is right thta future ages will correctly judge to be monstrous. The fact that everybody is convinced of something is no guarantee that it isn't evil horseshit."

"Being human, a key coping mechanism [to the Black Death] was guilt, but a sort of arrogant, self-aggrandizing guilt. 'This must be our fault', everyone thought, in a maelstrom of self-loathing and self-involvement". 'God is angry with us, and that's why this is happening. Aren't we careless, powerless fools. Curse us, for we have become too mighty.' I am thoroughly convinced by the overwhelming scientific evidence of humanity's role in climate change and the consequent need to inhabit the planet less impactfully. That fact is beyond doubt, and those who do doubt it imperil our survival. Let me get that on record first. However, the only meaningful counter-argument that could be made is thta humanity always thinks it's responsible for everything. We always reckon it's about us. We love taking credit for thing, but, where no credit is available, we'll settle for blame rather than entertaining the horrendously humbling notion that something, anything at all, might have nothing to do with us. The reason that climate change deniers seldom make that potentially persuasive argument is that they're even more weak-mindedly obsessed with human significance than average, so their arguments are all based on conspiracies and secrets and other malevolent aspects of human agency. They're not up for the 'We had nothing to do with this' narrative at all; they just opt for a different pattern of blaming humans, because they're delusional fuckwits who don't understand science....Still, I hope the solemn self-important guilt that people resorted to in their bewilderment and grief gave them some sort of comfort, some feeling of significance in the face of a bacterial tsunami for which they were no more than a fertile shore."  
--David Mitchell, I have been hearing the 'Earth just goes through cycles' argument more, so his point doesn't perfectly land, but it is true that the religious still among us like to overplay human significance, all while accusing secular society of pridefulness

"But the Black Death is such a reminder of mortality, of the futility of human endeavor, that it makes the grandiose enterprise of conquest, successful though it usually was during Edward's reign, seem dafter than ever....The Black Prince...This renowned warrior's tomb is in Canterbury cathedral, where there is a bronze effigy of him in fully armor...In his will he asked for the following poem to be inscribed around it:  
'Such as thou art, sometime was I  
Such as I am, such shalt thou be  
I thought little on the hour of death  
So long as I enjoyed breath  
On earth, I had great riches  
Land, houses, great treasure  
Horses, money, and gold  
But now a wretched captive am I  
Deep in the ground, low here I lie  
My beauty great is all quite gone  
My flesh wasted to the bone'  
In his slow decline from renown in to sickness, he must have realized that, when it comes to the human condition, glory only treats the symptoms."

You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples. There are no nations. There are no peoples. There are no Russions. There are no Arabs. There are no Third Worlds. There is no West! There is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars. Petrol dollars, electro-dollars, multi-dollars, reichsmarks, rins, rubles, pounds, and shekels. It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today. That is the atomic, and subatomic, and galactic structure of things today. And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature. And you will atone! Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale? You get up on your little 21 inch screen and howl about America and democracy. There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and Dupont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today. What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state? Karl Marx? They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories, minimax solutions and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments just like we do.

And I don't mean the communists are gonna take over the world, because the communists are deader than we are. What is finished is the idea that this great counry is dedicated to the freedom and flourishing of every individual in it. It's the individual that's finished. It's the single, solitary human being that's finished. It's every single one of you out there that's finished, because this is no longer a nation of independent individuals. It's a nation of some 200-odd million transistorized, deodorized, whiter than white, steel-belted bodies, totally unnecessary as human beings and as replaceable as piston rods....The whole world's people are becoming mass-produced, programmed, numbered, insensate things."

"Solzhenitsyn said in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech 'A single person who stops lying can bring down a tyranny.', which is a stunning thing to say, but I would also say something that's been amply demonstrated in the 20th century, because we have historical examples of people who did precisely that. Gandhi did it. Vaclav Havel did it. Nelson Mandela did it. Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago was definitely one of the axe-blows that brought down the Soviet Union, a stunning achievement for a person who started writing that book by memorizing it when he was a concentration camp victim this [holds up pinched fingers] far away from starvation. It shows you as-as clearly as anything possibly can how powerful the human spirit can be if it's willing to take on the obligation of its relationship with the divine and also how terrible things can become if the responsibility of that burden is not shouldered."

"Rather, I want to suggest what may be a wider lesson about software, (and probably about every kind of creative or professional work).

NYTimes interviewer: "But why does compassion have to be universal?"  
"Because this is different from moral judgment. It doesn't prevent you from saying [Putin and Assad] are walking psychopaths. But compassion is to remedy suffering wherever it is, whatever form it takes, and whomever causes it. If someone beats you with a stick, you don't get angry with the stick, you get angry with the person. These people we are talking about are like sticks in the hands of ignorance and hatred."

But whatever the meaning and purpose of this universe, you are a legitimate part of it.

"In one particularly telling real-world example from 2016 of how such cuts affected students in the “brick and mortar” district, high school junior Jameria Miller talks about why she starts every morning running through the school to get a good seat near the front of the room in her first-period Spanish class. It’s not because she is just excited about the class. It’s because the school is cold. As she explains, “The cold is definitely a distraction. We race to class to get the best blankets.” What she means is that because the classroom where she begins her day has uninsulated metal walls, Jameria’s teacher hands out blankets to the students on a first come, first served basis. It’s the only way for them to stay warm. Miller’s school in the William Penn District is situated in Philadelphia’s “inner-ring” suburbs and serves a student body that is majority Black and overwhelmingly impoverished. Though concentrating in the cold is hard enough, Miller says the hardest part of her daily ordeal is the knowledge that life isn’t like this for students in other districts. She means students in wealthier districts. “It’s never going to be fair, they’re always going to be a step ahead of us. They’ll have more money than us, and they’ll get better jobs than us, always.” She says she doesn’t believe that either funding or systemic school improvement will ever truly equalize: 'What I'm about to say might not be very nice, but rich people aren’t going to want [funding fairness]. They want their kids to have better things so that their kids can get a jump start in life and be ahead of everyone else. And, as long as people feel that way, we all won’t be equal. We won’t receive equal education ever, because education is what gets you success.'"

"Historically: the coffee house, the tavern, the *third place*, the not-work, not-home public, social space where you could have people of different social classes, backgrounds, creeds all come together and bump up against each other [is lost when we're all on our phones]. Sometimes that might lead to trouble, but often it did lead to a kind of tolerance that I think is far different than our modern understanding of tolerance, which is: Tolerance is very much a list of all the things you're supposed to accept and endorse ["In this house we believe..."], versus real human tolerance...is about understanding human nature and accepting its limitations."  
--Christine Rosen, on Andrew Sullivan's Dishcast

"Often in relationships between men and women, there is this weird pact that it's the women's job to interpret their relationship for the men. That they have a right to say, 'The problem with you is that you're afraid of commitment, and if only you would show up at my house at an approximately reasonable time, then we would be fine.' And that is bullshit: that the men are ready to outsource their own understanding of themselves to the women, and that the women will do that job so the men will do what they want. And yet it's a sort of agreed-upon game."

'For Roupenian, it has been a case of recognizing a tendency to overestimate the extend to which "someone else has control over my happiness and ability to move in the world", and, by extension, her control over others: "That if you're unhappy, it's my fault, and my job to fix it. I do have a responsibility to make other people happy. You have to be a good person. But that is contradicted by the thing I have felt increasingly as I get older, which is that I do not have the power to make you happy. My ability to fix you is so limited, and my desire to fix you is complicated. For me, the process of getting older and seeing things more truly has been realizing how little power we have over each other."'

“From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here, that's home, that's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar", every "supreme leader", every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there----on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conciets than this distant image of our tiny world.

"Those worlds in space are as countless as all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the earth. Each  of those worlds is as real as ours. In every one of them there’s a succession of incidents, events, occurrences which influence its future. Countless worlds, numberless moments, an immensity of space and time. And our small planet at this moment: here we face a critical branch point in history. What we do with our world right now will propagate down through the centuries and powerfully affect the destiny of our descendents. It is well within our power to destroy our civilization and perhaps our species as well. If we capitulate to superstition or greed or stupidity, we could plunge our world into a darkness deeper than the time between the collapse of classical civilization and the Italian  Renaissance. But we’re also capable of using our compassion and our intelligence, our technology and our wealth, to make an abundant and meaningful life for every inhabitant of this planet, to enhance  enormously our understanding of the universe and to carry us to the stars."

"When I was in college the Cold War had just ended. I entered college the same year the Soviet Union collapsed. And for a variety of reasons I developed this interest in mid-20th century literature by anti-totalitarian writers, people like Hannah Arendt and Miłosz and a bunch of other figures both from behind the Iron Curtain--Václav Havel--and in the Free World who really thought deeply about the totalitarian phenomenon. And what has struck me profoundly in the last 5 or 6 years is how the psychological categories--the desire to obey, the willingness to be misled so long as you're made to feel as if you belong--, that those methods by which totalitarianism or post-totalitarianism societies were able to rule and to stay in power, that the Trump playbook recalls those methods to an eerie degree, and it's really worth re-reading those books."

"...this insistence on orthodoxy and on everything that has always ever been, even though it hasn't always ever been this way. And I think that orthodoxy is to religion what ideology is to politics, and that real politics and real religion happens when you leave those behind and you experience the world and you experience your faith in a powerful way. And that also means, if you are a Christian, the lack of any desire to force anybody to behave or to do things or to believe things that they don't want to do themselves. ... And the idea that we can police the world into believing in certain th8ings, and use the power of government or law to enforce it, is evil. Evil. ... I'm trying to reimagine what Christianity could be today, as Christianity that's not afraid of the modern world, that sees every human being as a creation of God and worth loving."

"Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that 'computer science' is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called *procedural epistemology*--the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of 'what is'. Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of 'how to'."  
--Gerald and Julie Sussman, Harold Abelson (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)

"...the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are *search* and *learning*.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;...the actual contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex; we should stop trying to find simple ways to think about the contents of minds.... All these are part of the arbitrary, intrinsically-complex, outside world. They are not what should be built in, as their complexity is endless; instead we should build in only the meta-methods that can find and capture this arbitrary complexity. Essential to these methods is that they can find good approximations, but the search for them should be by our methods, not by us. We want AI agents that can discover like we can, not which contain what we have discovered."

"I hesitate to give advice because every major single piece of advice I was given turned out to be wrong and I am glad I didn’t follow them. I was told to focus and I never did. I was told to never procrastinate and I waited 20 years for the Black Swan and it sold 3 million copies. I was told to avoid putting fictional characters in my books and I did put in Nero Tulip and Fat Tony because I got bored otherwise. I was told to not insult the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, the more I insulted them the nicer they were to me and solicit Op-Eds. I was told to avoid lifting weights for a back pain and became a weightlifter: never had a back problem since.

"So when we look at religion and, to some extent ancestral superstitions, we should consider what purpose they serve, rather than focusing on the notion of “belief”, epistemic belief in its strict scientific definition. In science, belief is literal belief; it is right or wrong, never metaphorical. In real life, belief is an instrument to do things, not the end product. This is similar to vision: the purpose of your eyes is to orient you in the best possible way, and get you out of trouble when needed, or help you find a prey at distance. Your eyes are not sensors aimed at getting the electromagnetic spectrum of reality. Their job description is not to produce the most accurate scientific representation of reality; rather the most useful one for survival."

"He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign. If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."  
--Lao Tzu

"The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself."  
--Lao Tzu

"Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy who is already defeated. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself in to a position that makes defeat impossible and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory."

"That general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack."

"Most thrilling was Hamming's vivid image of *greatness*, and its unapologetic pursuit. Not only was it allowable to aim for greatness, it was cowardly not to. It was the most inspirational thing I'd ever read.  
...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nothing is taken for granted or left unquestioned, but is picked up and turned over curiosly, intently, searching for fundamentals.  
...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For one accustomed to the myopia of day-to-day work in a field, so jammed against the swaggering parade of passing trends that one can hardly see beyond them or beneath them, such shifts in viewpoint are exhilarating--a reminder that information may be abundant but wisdom is rare.  
...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But Hamming stands alone. Certainly for the thoroughness with which he presents his style of thinking, and more so for explicitly identifying style as a thing that exists and can be learned in the first place. But most of all, for his expectation--his insistence--that the reader is destined to join him in extending the arc of history, to become a *great person* who does *great work*. In this tour of scientific greatness, the reader is not a passenger, but a driver in training.  
...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hamming insisted on an open door, lunched with anyone he could learn from or argue with, stormed in and out of colleagues' offices.  
...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The joke around Princeton was that John von Neumann 'was not human, but a demigod who had made a detailed study of humans and could imitate them perfectly'. Bad news for any aspiring von Neumanns of more terrestrial stock.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hamming's conviction--indeed, obsession--was the opposite: that this greatness was less a matter of genius (or divinity), and more a kind of virtuosity. He saw these undeniably great figures as human beings that had *learned* how to do something, and by studying them, he could learn it too.  
...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hamming-greatness is thus more a practice than a trait.  
...

"Fiction's about what it is to be a fucking human being."  
--David Foster Wallace

"Blind certainty: A closed-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn't even know he's locked up."  
--David Foster Wallace

"But if you really *learn how to think*, how to pay attention, then you will know you have other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell-type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that lit the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down--not that that mystical stuff's necessarily true; the only thing that's capital-T True is that you get to decide how you're gonna try to see it.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This, I submit, is the freedom of real education, of learning how to be 'well adjusted': You get to consiously decide what has meaning and what doesn't. You get to decide what to *worship*. Because here's something else that's weird but true: In the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshiping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is *what* to worship. And a compelling reason for *maybe* choosing some sort of God or spiritual-type thing to worship, be it JC or Allah, be it Yahweh or the Wiccan mother goddess or the four noble truths or some inviolable set of ethical principles, is that prettymuch anything else you worship will *eat you alive*.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure, and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On one level we all know this stuff already. It's been codified as myths, proverbs, cliches, epigrams, parables, the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciouness.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Worship power; you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Look, the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful; it is that they are *unconscious*. They are default settings. They're the kind of worship you just gradually slip in to, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value, without ever being fully aware that that's what you're doing.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And the so-called 'real world' will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called 'real world' of *men* and *money* and *power* hums merrily along on the fuel of *fear* and *anger* and *frustration* and *craving* and the worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom, the freedom all to be lords of our own tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the center of all creation.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talked about in the great outside world of wanting and achieving and displaying. The really important kind of freedom involves *attention* and *awareness* and *discipline* and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day. That is real freedom. That is being educated and understanding *how to think*.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the *rat race*, the constant gnawing sense of having had and lost some infinite thing. ...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death. The capital-T Truth is about life *before* death. It is about the *real* value of a *real* education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge and everything to do with simple awareness, awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us all the time that we have to keep reminding ourselves, over and over: 'This is water.' 'This is water.'  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out, which means yet another grand cliche turns out to be true: Your education really is the job of a lifetime, and it commences now. I wish you way more than luck."

"The world is a tragedy to those who feel, but a comedy to those who think."  
--Horace Walpole

"Each time I see a headline announcing that officials from the United States and China are once more butting heads, I feel that the state of affairs is more than just tragic, it is comical too, because I am sure that no two peoples are more alike than Americans and Chinese. A strain of materialism, often crass, runs through both countries, sometimes producing veneration of successful entrepreneurs, sometimes creating displays of extraordinary tastelessness, overall contributing to a spirit of vigorous competition. Chinese and Americans are pragmatic. They have a get-it-done attitude that occassionally produces hurried work. Both countries are full of hustlers peddling shortcuts, especially to health and to wealth. Their peoples have an appreciation for the technological sublime, the awe of grand projects pushing physical limits. American and Chinese elites are often uneasy with the political views of the broader populace. But masses and elites are united in the faith that theirs is a uniquely powerful nation that ought to throw its weight around if smaller countries don't get in line."  
--Dan Wang, *Breakneck*, Introduction

"Silicon Valley can be an amazingly drab place. The peninsula south of San Francisco has natural beauty, with rolling hills and coastal views, but you strain to see them beyond so many corporate parking lots. Mountain View and Menlo Park are bizarely full of rug shops. So when I walk through the towns that host the headquarters of AI leaders and some of the richest companies in the world, I often find myself wondering '*This* is the beating heart of our technologically accelerating civilization?' Each time I flew from California to Hong Kong or Shanghai I felt almost unnerved to encounter functional infrastucture. Going from the airport into a subway, rather than an Uber, is an outstanding way to be welcomed to Asia. I would take a moment to savor a clean station, brightly lit, with trains running every few minutes, which would drop me off at a downtown filled with vibrant commercial areas---another feature that San Francisco lacks. Life in the Bay Area, an economic dynamo in America's richest state, can feel awfully dysfunctional. San Francisco has been unable to serve its homeless population, and even many wealthy people have to keep a generator for their extraordinarily expensive houses, because the state can't keep the lights on. The contradicton of the Bay Area, this red hot center of corporate value creation that is surrounded by dysfunction, fuels the inquiry of this book.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When I departed from Silicon Valley for China in 2017, it felt clear that the United States had lost something special over the past four decades. While China was building the future, America had become physically static, its innovations mostly bound up in the virtual and financial worlds. Looking at these two countries, I came to realize the inadequacy of 20<sup>th</sup> Century labels like 'capitalist', 'socialist', or, worst of all, 'neoliberal'. They are no longer up to the task of helping us understand the world, if they ever were. Capitalist America intrudes upon the free market with a dense program of regulation and taxation while providing substantial, albeit imperfect, redistributive policies. Socialist China detains union organizers, levies light taxes, and provides a threadbare social safety net. The greatest trick that the Communist party every pulled off is masquerading as leftist. While Xi Jinping and the rest of the Politburo mouth Marxist pieties, the state is enacting a rightwing agenda that Western conservatives would salivate over, administering limited welfare, erecting enormous bariers to immigration, and enforcing traditional gender roles, where men have to be macho and women have to bear their children. China is an engineering state which can't stop itself from building, facing off against America's lawyerly society, which blocks everything it can. Engineers have quite literally ruled modern China: As a corrective to the mayhem of the Mao years, Deng Xiaoping promoted engineers to the top ranks of China's government throughout the 1980s and 1990s. By 2002 all 9 members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of the Communist party, had trained as engineers."  
--Dan Wang, *Breakneck*, beginning of chapter 1, Engineers vs. Lawyers

"What do engineers like to do? *Build*."  
--Dan Wang, *Breakneck, Engineers vs. Lawyers. Reminds me of many days spent with Legos and that the beaver truly is the best mascot MIT could have chosen.

"The United States by contrast has a government of the lawyers, by the lawyers, and for the lawyers. Five out of the last ten presidents attended law school. In any given year at least half the US Congress has law degrees, while at best a handful of members have studied science or engineering....only two American presidents worked as engineers: Herbert Hoover, who built a fortune in mining, and Jimmy Carter, who served as an engineering officer on a nuclear submarine. Hoover and Carter are remembered for many things, especially for their dismal political instincts that produced thumping electoral defeats.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Lawyers have so many tools available to delay or prevent building. You don't just feel the difference going from the lawyerly society to the engineering state; you saunter, tread, and amble upon its works. Americans no longer manufacture well or build public works on reasonable timelines. US infrastructure is falling into a pitiable state, while China is building new systems of subways, bridges, and highways....Lawyers enable some of the success of Silicon Valley; you can't build companies worth trillions without legal protections. But lawyers are also part of the reason that the Bay Area and much of the country are starved of housing and mass transit. The United States used to be, like China, an engineering state, but in the 1960s the priorities of elite lawyers took a sharp turn. As Americans grew alarmed by the unpleasant byproducts of growth---environmental destruction, excessive highway construction, corporate interests above public interests---the focus of lawyers turned to litigation and regulation. The mission became to stop as many things as possible."  
--Dan Wang, *Breakneck*, Engineers vs. Lawyers

"[China]'s leaders aren't only civil or electrical engineers; they are, fundamentally, *social* engineers."  
--Dan Wang, *Breakneck*

"The engineering state can be awfully literal-minded. Sometimes it feels like China's leadership is made up entirely of hydaulic engineers who view the economy and society as liquid flows, as if all human activity, from mass production to reproduction, can be directed, restricted, increased or blocked with the same ease as turning a series of valves. Can a government be too efficient? Six years in China taught me that the answer is 'yes' when it is unbounded by citizen input. There are many self-limiting aspects of a system that makes snap decisions with so little regard for people. This book reveals good things that the engineering state does---running functional cities, building up its manufacturing base, and spreading material benefits pretty widely throughout society---, but I also lived through things that no other state would have attempted, like holding on to a zero covid strategy until it drove the counntry mad. The fundamental tenet of the engineering state is to look at people as aggregates, not individuals. The Communist party envisions itself as a grandmaster, coordinating unified actions across state and society, able to launch strategic maneuvers beyond the comprehension of its citizens. Its philosophy is to maximize the discretion of the state and minimize the rights of individuals. Engineers often treat social issues as math exercises. Does the country have too many people? Beijing's solution was to prohibit families from birthing more than one child...through mass sterilization and abortion campaigns, as the central government ordered in 1980. Is the noval coronavirus spreading too quickly? Build new hospitals at breathtaking speed, yes, but also confine people to their homes as Wuhan, Xi'an, and Shanghai did, to millions of people over weeks....There is no confusion about the purpose of Zero Covid or the One Child Policy; the number is right there in the name.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;China's economy isn't immune to engineering either. When Beijing grew uncomfortable with the debt levels of real estate developers in 2021, the state forced so many of them into distress that it triggered a prolonged slump in home buyer confidence. Around the same time, Xi hurled a series of regulatory thunderbolts at China's high-flying tech companies....Chinese tech founders and their investors were astonished to discover that Xi Jinping could erase a trillion dollars from corporate valuations over the course of just a few months. The leadership thought it was straightforward to reorient the nation's tech priorities away from consumer platforms and toward science-based industries like semiconductors and aviation that serve the nation's strategic needs. Beijing took years to appreciate how its actions had scared the daylights out of entrepreneurs and investors.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When you travel around China, it's staggering to see how much the engineering approach has accomplished over the past four decades. Then there's the part you can't see. As impressive as China's railways and bridges may be, they carry enormous levels of debt that drag down broader growth. Manufacturers produce so many goods that China's trade partners are now grumbling for protection. The social engineering experiemnt known as the One Child Policy has accelerated the country's demographic decline. And China's economy would be in better shape if Beijing hadn't triggered an implosion of its property sector, smothered many of its most dynamic companies, and persisted in trying to push out the coronavirus....[I]n China many pillars of society are liable to blow over when winds from Beijing shift direction, contributing to a sense of precarity among even the country's elites. Since China doesn't have many legal protections, not even its rich are well protected.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Engineers go hard in one direction, and if they perceive something isn't working, they switch, with no loss of speed, toward another. They don't suffer criticism from *humanist softies*. Change in China can be so dramatic because so few voices are part of the political process."  
--Dan Wang, *Breakneck*, Engineers vs. Lawyers. It's government [by autists](#autism)!

"Americans live today in the ruins of an industrial civilization"  
--Dan Wang, Engineers vs. Lawyers

"In the 1960s parts of the United States had grown into a frightful place. Oil platforms discharged petroleum into the sea. A foul smog settled over cities. And factories leaked so many chemicals that even rivers combusted. Urban planners rammed highways through urban neighborhoods. Legal discrimination segregated people by race and blocked them from excercising the right to vote. The public soured on the idea of broad deference to US technocrats and engineers....Through the 1970s both the American left and the right worked harmoniously to constrain government effectiveness. Liberal activists like Ralph Nader declared themselves to be 'watchdogs' of government, constantly filing lawsuits. Ronald Reagan returned the compliment when he replied 'Government is the problem, not the solution.' The lawyerly society grew out of a necessary corrective to the United States' problems of the 1960s. Unfortunately it has become the cause of many of its present problems.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;...Though the political views of law students may twist in unexpected directions, we should keep in view that they are entwined most firmly around a pillar of personal ambition. More than any other group in the United States, lawyers are afforded the license to be generalists, permitted to stomp into whichever intellectual realm pleases them....In recent decades, lawyers have been able to muscle out economists even in economic policy making. The Biden administration was staffed by many graduates of Yale Law who were willing to ignore the logic of the Invisible Hand [Adam Smith]. Instead, they roll up their sleeves to perform surgery on the American economy, one case at a time, devising a subsidy scheme for one corporation, or bringing an anti-trust case against another. Lawyers create so many complications that the rules governing everything from healthcare and housing to banking have become incomprehensible. The American courtroom is a battlefront to resolve political questions, in which judges are enlisted to rule on questions that most other countries leave to voters or regulators. When a political cause can't be won through the electoral process, lawyers sometimes seek a victory through the courts....  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Though the lawyerly society corrected the problems of the past, it has produced two pathologies that weaken the United States today. The first is an elevation of *process* over *outcomes*. In American government and society, designing new rules and committees have so often become the substitute for thinking hard about strategy and ends. While engineers envision bridges, lawyers envision procedures. In a seminal paper titled [The Procedure Fetish](https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-procedure-fetish/) University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley outlines how the federal government requires an agency to 'conduct every conceivable study, ventilate every option, engage every identifiable stakeholder, and weather the most stringent judicial review before any of its actions, however trivial, could take effect'. In the lawyerly society, a more rigorous process is the solution to any number of quandries. To deal with a new problem it designs another procedure, which usually entails longer bureaucratic deliberation, greater public discussion, and more intensive judicial review. Lawyers have much more scope with the law to stop something rather than create something....Americans are left with decaying infrastructure, little new construction, and a deep sense that nothing is working.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It's not just the government. American's problem is the lawyerly *society*. The United States is unusual among Western countries for having so many lawyers, 400 lawyers per 100,000 people, which is three times higher than the average in European countries. Since lawyers are everywhere, proceduralism has reached everywhere, including universities and corporations. Anyone working in these today has seen how procedures become an end in themselves, such that people grow obsessed with their logic and forget about the outcome. Because who can keep the goal straight after the seventh monthly committee meeting? The other problem of the lawyerly soceity is a systematic bias toward the well-off. Lawyers are too often servants of the rich. They help wealthy homeowners block construction projects or get creative with their taxes....Litigation offers endlessly tantalizing possibilities for settling scores. And motivated parties are willing to pay top dollar for superstar lawyers. Lawyers aren't just defenders of the rich; many of them are the rich. 'On Wall Street Lawyers Make More Than Bankers Now' was a headline from the Wall Stree Journal in 2023. 'Pay for Lawyers is so high, people are comparing it to the NBA' claimed the New York Times in 2024. America's dysfunctions are not obstacles for the rich. Though New York City has barely been able to extend its system of mass transit, real estate developers have been able to build skinny highrises for the wealthy. Though California can't tame wildfires, the rich might be able to afford their own private firefighting services. The poor, those buried under paperwork trying to apply for SNAP benefits, who have to take dilapidated public transit and who would benefit most from new construction, are the ones who suffer most from the lawyerly society's failures.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am not saying, as Shakespeare's Dick the Butcher snipes in Henry VI pt.2 that 'The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers'. The system of checks and balances has been and is fundamental to the success of the United States. Since the government is capable of wielding terrible power, judges and the law are often the last---and best---hope against abuses. But the United States will not remain a great power if it caters primarily to the wealthy. Its failure to build enough has hurt working people, and makes the country feel like a low-agency society."  
--Dan Wang, fellow of Yale Law School's China Center', Engineers vs. Lawyers. Reminds me of program managers wanting to design their own little feature to already-overburdened software projects. Drives me nuts. They're just creating more work for themselves at this point. It's exactly [John Gall's point](#systemantics).

"In the words of one 1991 paper written by a trio of economists, 'Our evidence shows that countries with a higher proportion of engineering college majors grow faster, whereas countries with a higher proportion of law concentrators grow more slowly.' Engineers are part of the reason that China has grown so much wealthier, despite its wavering commitment to secure property rights. An engineer mindset is also part of the reason that the state skirted so close to apocalypse, in the case of the Cultural Revolution, before it achieved a growth miracle."  
--Dan Wang, Enginers vs. Lawyers

"[I]n political terms, this obsession with process over outcomes has made Americans lose faith that the government can meaningfully improve their lives. I want the US government to earn back that faith. To do so, it will need to recover some of its engineering prowess and make room for non-lawyers among its ruling elites. It will require the Unites States to build again, creating a momentum and the sense of optimism for the future that many Chinese have felt over the past two decades."  
--Dan Wang, Enginers vs. Lawyers

"The reason we have to get smarter about both the United States and China is not because they are fascinating intellectual puzzles in themselves. It is because the two superpowers are uneasily circling each other, reorienting their economies and national security apparatuses to prepare for conflict. As the China and United States gear up for competition and conflict, we need fresh ways, using terms that are not amalgamations from political science texts, to think about how both countries function and how they fail. The Engineering State and the Lawyerly Society are not the only ways to understand the two countries. Old labels like 'autocratic' or 'capitalist' still have some use, of course. I want to be inventive and even playful with these terms, in the interest of encouraging mutual curiosity between the two countries. The United States has immense advantages over China: robust economic growth, an expanding and more youthful population, innovation in digital technologies, a larger network of alliances, and more. But we need to recognize that the Engineering State has a giant advantage: China can build. That will matter if the two countries ever decide, in an apocalyptic scenario, to go to war. No military can be powered by artificial intelligence alone. It will need drones and munitions, and the Engineering State is better set up to produce these in overwhelming quantity. Over the past decade, the United States brought lawyers to a technology fight. The first Trump administration blacklisted scores of Chinese tech companies....Lawyers have designed equisite webs of technology controls, ensnaring Chinese chipmakers, telecommunications firms, and any company hoping to deploy AI. Rather than halt Chinese technology leaders in their tracks, these legal controls have riled them up. When Xi started his third term in 2022, he didn't stack the Politburo with clever lawyers able to deliver a really good rebuttal; he filled it with scientists and engineers. They will help to design the 15<sup>th</sup> 5 year plan, which will place even greater emphasis on building technological strength. A contest between a literal-minded dragon and lawyerly weenies wouldn't be a fair fight. The struggle is more complex than that. Whether one can outlast the other will depend not only on physical dynamism or technological prowess, it will depend on governance, which country can do a better job managing its affairs over the next century.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As best as I can tell, the United States and China are both racing to erode their governance capabilities. Xi Jinping has forcefully centered the political decision-making process on himself, demonstrating that he intends to rule the Communist party for as long as he pleases. The American government, meanwhile, has been mired in ineffectualness. For decades the American right connived to drown the government in a bathtub while the left was strangling it with rules and lawsuits. The left has barely shown resolve to reform creaky institutions, and the second Trump administration behaves as if it must destroy the government in order to save it. But there is hope for everyone. The most important thing that China and the United States share is a commitment to transformation....'the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation'. The US commitment is more open-ended, inherent to the experiment to keep democracy going. That has been partly deformed, but we should revive the dream that governmnet of the people, but the people, and for the people shall not perish."

"The men ask me questions like, 'How would you calculate the number of people who work for the United States Postal Service?' and 'How would you describe the internet to a medieval farmer?' and 'What is the hardest thing you've ever done?' They tell me to stand in front of the whiteboard and diagram my responses. These questions are self-conscious and infuriating, but it only serves to fuel me. I want to impress; I refuse to be discouraged by their self-importance. Here is a character flaw, my industry origin story: I have always responded positively to negging."

"My third interview is with the technical cofounder. He enters the conference room in a crisp blue button-down, looking confidently unprepared. He tells me--apologetically--that he hasn't done many interviews before, and as such he doesn't have a ton of questions to ask me. Nonetheless, the office manager slated an hour for our conversation. This seems OK: I figure we will talk about the company, I will ask routine follow-up questions, and at four they will let me out for the day, like a middle school student, and the city will absorb me and my private errors. Then he tells me that his girlfriend is applying to law school and he's been helping her prep. So instead of a conventional interview, he's just going to have me take a section of the LSAT. I search his face to see if he's kidding."   
"'If it's cool with you, I'm just going to hang out here and check my email.' he says, sliding the test across the table and opening a laptop. He sets a timer."

"I think about the city I left to come here, the plans I've canceled and the friends I haven't made. I think about how hard I've worked and how demoralizing it is to fail.

"A deus ex machina is generally deemed undesirable in writing and often implies a lack of creativity on the part of the author. The reasons for this are that it does not pay due regard to the story's internal logic (although it is sometimes deliberately used to do this) and is often so unlikely that it challenges suspension of disbelief, allowing the author to conclude the story with an unlikely, though perhaps more palatable, ending."

"There is, in that part of Europe particularly [northern] but more generally speaking in Europe, there is a tie to the community, to the land, to history, to a sense of your life revolving around a certin kind of communitarian identity that is very hard to replicate in the United States. You know, the United States is this big, brash, churning economic entity where people move. There's a much greater sense of you're always trying to remake yourself. It's the story of reinvention. Everyone is Jay Gatsby at some level. And that turns out to leave a lot of hollowness inside, that leaves a sense of 'Where do I fit in?' And I think so much of what has happened in America in the last 10 or 15, 20 years is this growing sense of hollowness, particularly for example for men; this is something Richard Reeves [author of *Of Boys and Men*, which is excellent] talks about a lot. And I think that that part of Europe in particular [northern]---small, clan-based, community-oriented---has managed to keep that sense of identity and keep that sense of purpose and community. And how you do that, it's in a way the fundamental challenge for liberal societies, because what liberalism did is it broke away from the certitude of faith, the certitude of tradition, the certitude of community, and it said 'You're free to make your own life' and for you to then define your life, the happiness of your life, exactly as you want. No priest is going to tell you this, no commissar is going to tell you this, no dictator is going to tell you this. And what people found was that it caused enormous anxiety. Kierkegaard says 'Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.', and I think we live with that dizziness of freedom in the Unites States, and that's a harder one. How do you fill that hole in the heart that people get when they are confronting modern life without the certainties of the old?"  
Ezra: "So this has become a popular critique of America, and I have to say that I only half buy it....You're telling me---not you, but the imaginary national conservative here on the stage---that New York City doesn't have identity? That it doesn't have a pulse unto iteself? That it is not a place that people become a fierce partisan of? I'm from California; I find the level of fierce New York City partisanship quite irksome....There's something here that always feels wrong to me, because the backlash is not coming from within the place that has supposedly lost the thing that should hold it together. The backlash is coming from other places that have a growing anger at these centers of cosmopolitan industry and belonging."  
"I like what you're saying, and I think the way I'd put it is: The Ezra Klein amendment to Kierkegaard is 'Anxiety is the dizziness of somebody else's freedom.'"
