“When you walk through the storm, hold your head high
And don't be afraid of the dark!
At the end of the storm is a golden sky
And the sweet song of the lark.
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone!”  
--Douglas Adams

"...they discovered only a small asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying."  
--Douglas Adams

"Well, I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point, I'm afraid, where you begin to suspect that the entire multidimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs. And if it comes to a choice between spending yet another ten million years finding that out, and on the other hand just taking the money and running, then I for one could do with the exercise."  
--Douglas Adams

"and we’ll be saying a big hello to all intelligent life forms everywhere … and to everyone else out there, the secret is to bang the rocks together, guys."  
--Douglas Adams

"Vogon poetry is of course, the third worst in the universe. 
The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their poet master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning" four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging, and the president of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos was reported to have been "disappointed" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his 12-book epic entitled "My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles" when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save humanity, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain."  
--Douglas Adams

“Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.
The argument goes something like this: "I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."
"But," says Man, "The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED."
"Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.
"Oh, that was easy," says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.”  
--Douglas Adams

"I love deadlines. I love the wooshing sound they make as they go by."  
--Douglas Adams

"The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't."  
--Douglas Adams

"You talked to it?" exclaimed Ford. "What do you mean you talked to it?" "Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its extermal computer feed. I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it," said Marvin. "And what happened?" pressed Ford. "it commited suicide," said Marvin, and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold."  
--Douglas Adams

"Yes I passed on your message to Mr. Zarniwoop, but I'm afraid he's too cool to see you right now." "Look," said Zaphod, "I'm up to here with cool, okay? I am so amazingly cool you could keep a side of meat in me for a month. I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis."  
--Douglas Adams

--Douglas Adams

"So, how are you?" he said aloud. "Oh, fine," said Marvin, "if you happend to like being me, which personally I don't."  
--Douglas Adams

"Hello," said the elevator sweetly, "I am to be your elevator for this trip to the floor of your choice. ..." "Yeah," said Zaphod, stepping into it, "what else do you do besides talk?" "I go up," said the elevator, "or down." "Good," said Zaphod, "we're going up." "Or down," the elevator reminded him. "Yeah, okay, up please." There was a moment of silence. "Down's very nice," suggested the elevator hopefully. "Oh yeah?" "Super." "Good," said Zaphod, "now will you take us up?" "May I ask you," inquired the elevator in its sweetest, most reasonable voice, "if you've considered all the possibilities that down might offer you?" Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall."  
--Douglas Adams

"Modern elevators are strange and complex entities. The ancient electric winch and "maximum-capacity-eight-persons" jobs bear as much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital."  
--Douglas Adams

"The desk, apart from a bit of dancing dust and a single, revolutionary new form of paper clip, was empty."

"What about you, Colonel?  
My job isn't to believe or disbelieve. It's to act or not to act.  
...  
The other day, a young researcher asked me something.
He wondered if their power was the form the next stage of human evolution was taking, and perhaps that we'll all be able to control it some day.  
Scientists are a bunch of romantics. Military men always consider the risks first. It's taken thirty long years. We've come so far from the rubble. We can't just trade one for the other.  
I've always thought that you hated this city, Colonel.  
The passion to build has cooled and the joy of reconstruction forgotten, and now it's just a garbage heap made up of hedonistic fools.  
So you're trying to save the city, then?  
It's how a soldier thinks. A scientist wouldn't understand."  
--[Akira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(1988_film))

"Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact; it's an opinion. It's a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing."  
--Muhammad Ali

--David Brooks, New York Times

"Any book on happiness is likely to tell you to set clear goals on what you want to achieve and then work towards achieving them. The problem is it doesn't really work. You might become a millionaire by the time you're 40, but then you realize you haven't been able to sustain a happy relationship. Or when it doesn't work out you feel lost, and you blame yourself. When we live for our goals, we forget to live *now*. The philosopher Allen Watts made the point that when you listen to a piece of music, you don't just skip to the end because that's where it all comes together. You don't just read the last chapter of a book because that's the climax. Yet in life we're obsessed with endings. So you study for these exams so you can go to this university to get this job to work your way up to what? Eventually you reach some position in your 50s and you think "Is this it? Is this the thing. Is this what I've been working for?" And you forget that maybe life should be more like a piece of music, and you're supposed to be dancing."  
--Derren Brown

"We tend to dwell on our pasts and think that they somehow define who we are. But our pasts are just stories that we tell ourselves in the present...And we can be more skeptical of those stories if it helps us...We forget to apply the same natural skepticism to the most important stories we have, the ones we tell ourselves every day about who we are. And we can choose to change those stories."  
--Derren Brown

"This idea that those stories define us, in other words that it isn't really events that cause our problems but more our reactions to them, this all goes back to a Roman philosopher called Epictetus 2000 years ago. And Epictetus also gave us a great piece of advice, which I find helfpul every day. Epictetus said there are things in your life that you're in control of, and then there are things in your life that you're not in control of. So if you stop trying to control or change things that are not under your control anyway, you will of course remove a whole lot of pointless frustration and anxiety from your life. Right? He added to that: There are only two things that you are in control of: Your thoughts and your actions. That's it. So everything else, what other people do, what they think, what they think of you, how they behave, you can't control any of that anyway, so if you stop trying to, if you stop trying to fix it or change it in some way, if you just decide that anything on that side is fine and just let it go, nothing bad happens. You just feel better. You feel happier. You feel relief like you just put down a big heavy case of bricks."  
--Derren Brown

"...That is a miracle. And we can remember that when we tell ourselves we're a bit fat or our lives are a bit rubbish. This is the one life and the one body we have. We can tell ourselves a different story about it at least. We can be kinder to ourselves."  
--Derren Brown

"I strongly believe that engaging with life is about understanding that it's the choices we make right now that are important, not the habits of our past."  
--Derren Brown

"Living life fully is not just about fulfilling ambition, regardless of what motivational books tell you. It's also about being kinder."  
--Derren Brown

"Courage is not the absence of fear; it's the mastery of it."  
--Derren Brown

"About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some won't like you at all."  
--Rita Mae Brown

"Good judgment comes from experience, and often experience comes from bad judgment."  
--Rita Mae Brown

"There are many ways of breaking a heart. Stories were full of hearts broken by love, but what really broke a heart was taking away its dream - whatever that dream might be."  
--Pearl S. Buck

"Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned."  
--Buddha

"They may forget what you said, but they will never forget how you made them feel."  
--Carl Buehner

"A simple answer that is clear and precise will always have more power in the world than a complex one that is true."  
--Nolan Bushnell

"I think Atari's legacy is that we started the Silicon Valley ethic of engineers as rockstars."  
--Nolan Bushnell

"The nation that will insist upon drawing a broad line of demarcation between the fighting man and the thinking man is liable to find its fighting done by fools and its thinking by cowards."

--George Carlin

"Say what you want about America--land of the free, home of the brave--; we've got some dumb-ass motherfuckers floating around this country. Dumb-ass motherfuckers. Now obviously that doesn't include this audience. I understand that. You seem intelligent and perceptive, but the rest of them? Holy jumping fucking shit balls. Dumber than a second coat of paint."  
--George Carlin

"Google in the words auto-erotic asphyxia. Auto-erotic asphyxia. It's the practise of cutting off the oxygen to the brain at the last moment during masturbation in order to heighten the orgasm. And when I say common, 1000 kids a year die this way. Okay? 1000 of them die. So think how many of them are trying to pull this off, if you pardon the little pun that I throw in there. It's just to, just to lighten the mood. . . . So let's recap: Standing on a chair, rope around your neck, Peter in your hand. Now you have to time it just right so that just before you cum you almost die. And sometimes you miscalculate."  
--George Carlin

"We do think in language, and so the quality of our thoughts and ideas can only be as good as the quality of our language."

--[John Cleese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-p44-9S4O0&t=0m30s)

"I think the main thing is to understand that happiness or adjustment is much more an emotional state than an intellectual state."  
--[John Cleese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-p44-9S4O0&t=2m8s)

"I think the more that we have a disrespectful attitude towards our own egos, I think the happier life becomes. And I think the great problem of growing up in the moment, particularly for young people, is that you're told that if you're not rich and famous, your life is not really worthwhile. And that is such pernicious crap."  
--[John Cleese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-p44-9S4O0&t=2m29s)

"Extroverted values, which are to do with fame and money and status and positions, these are all things you have no control over. Do you see what I mean?

--[John Cleese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-p44-9S4O0&t=3m56s)

"So when I started to discover at Cambridge I could write stuff that made people laugh, then I began to watch the process. And I am quite convinced that anything of importance creatively comes up from the unconscious. There's a lot of *very* very bright, highly intellectual, immensely smart people, but they're 'left-brained', and they'll never, I think, be very, um, very creative."  
--[John Cleese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-p44-9S4O0&t=6m37s)

"When your unconscious gives you an idea, it doesn't give it neatly printed out on a piece of paper; it'll just give you an image or a feeling or something. And if you can stay with that and move around, eventually it'll make, make sense."

"On the show he [Fred Rogers] would say 'I love you just the way you are.' One day I said 'Fred, were you talking to me?' And he looked at me and he said 'Yes, I've been talking to you for two years. You finally heard me today.' And I just collapsed in to his arms. I-I started crying. That's when I knew that I loved him. No man had ever told me he loved me like that. I needed to hear it all my life."  
--Francois Clemmens, co-star on Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood

"In an age when politicians are judged first of all on personality, when the public assumes all of them to be deceitful, and when it’s easier and much more pleasurable to laugh about a political issue than to think about it, Johnson’s apparent self-deprecating honesty and lack of concern for his own dignity were bound to make him a hit."  
--Jonathan Coe, *Sinking Giggling into the Sea*

"These days, every politician is a laughing-stock, and the laughter which occasionally used to illuminate the dark corners of the political world with dazzling, unexpected shafts of hilarity has become an unthinking reflex on our part, a tired Pavlovian reaction to situations that are too difficult or too depressing to think about clearly."  
--Jonathan Coe

"The idea that politicians are morally inferior to the rest of us is ‘a convenient view, for it means we, the audience, the voters, are not to blame for anything: we are not to blame because we are the victims of a politics gone wrong.’"  
--Jonathan Coe quoting Steve Fielding

"In my experience, you truly serve only what you love; because service is love made visible."  
--Stephen Colbert

"So congratulations on the extra effort, Mercedes, which of course was a complete waste because Bloomberg Businessweek crunched the data this week comparing the satisfaction rankings with each company's stock price and found that '...customer-service scores have no relevance to stock market returns... the most-hated companies perform better...' and 'Your contempt really, truly doesn't matter... If anything, it might hurt company profits to spend money making customers happy.' That's right, folks, the Free Market has spoken, and it said 'Fuck you.'"  
--Stephen Colbert

"La vida tiene más imaginación que nuestros sueños se llevan."  
"Life has more imagination than we carry in our dreams."  
--Christopher Columbus

"Nothing that results from human progress is the result of unanimous consent. And those who are enlightened before the others are condemned to pursue that light in spite of others."  
--[1492, Conquest of Paradise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeDsa4Tw0c) (not a real Columbus quote)

"Ethics are so annoying. I avoid them on principle."  
--Darby Conley

"You're so young, way too young to be worried about not being smart enough. Until you're so old you start going senile, you have the opportunity to make yourself 'smarter'. And I put that in quotes because 'smart' is really just a way of saying 'has invested so much time and sweat that you make it look effortless'. You feel like you are burnt out or that you are on the verge of burning out, but in reality you are on the verge of deciding whether or not you will burn out. It's scary to acknowledge that it's a decision because it puts the onus on you to to do something about it, but it's empowering because it means there is something you can do about it.
So do it."  
--Internet Commentor

"It's not about being "smart", but about sustained focus, dedication, and discipline."  
--Internet Commentor

"That one's so stupid it underflows and becomes awesome."  
--StackOverflow Commentor

"Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press on' has solved and forever will solve the problems of the human race."  
--[Calvin Coolidge](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/01/12/persist/)

--Zaid Dahhaj

"One last drink, please."  
--Jack Daniels (allegedly his last words)

"The only competitor for the title of champion constructive mistranslation of all time also concerns virgins. Ibn Warraq has hilariously argued that in the famous promise of seventy-two virgins to every Muslim martyr, 'virgins' is a mistranslation of 'white raisins of crystal clarity'. Now, if only that had been more widely known, how many innocent victims of suicide missions might have been saved?"  
--Richard Dawkins

"[S]tudents from elite schools expect success, and expect it now. They have, by definition, never experienced anything else, and their sense of self has been built around their ability to succeed. The idea of not being successful terrifies them, disorients them, defeats them. They’ve been driven their whole lives by a fear of failure—often, in the first instance, by their parents’ fear of failure. The first time I blew a test, I walked out of the room feeling like I no longer knew who I was. The second time, it was easier; I had started to learn that failure isn’t the end of the world.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But if you’re afraid to fail, you’re afraid to take risks, which begins to explain the final and most damning disadvantage of an elite education: that it is profoundly anti-intellectual. This will seem counterintuitive. Aren’t kids at elite schools the smartest ones around, at least in the narrow academic sense? Don’t they work harder than anyone else—indeed, harder than any previous generation? They are. They do. But being an intellectual is not the same as being smart. Being an intellectual means more than doing your homework.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If so few kids come to college understanding this, it is no wonder. They are products of a system that rarely asked them to think about something bigger than the next assignment. The system forgot to teach them, along the way to the prestige admissions and the lucrative jobs, that the most important achievements can’t be measured by a letter or a number or a name. It forgot that the true purpose of education is to make minds, not careers.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Being an intellectual means, first of all, being passionate about ideas—and not just for the duration of a semester, for the sake of pleasing the teacher, or for getting a good grade. A friend who teaches at the University of Connecticut once complained to me that his students don’t think for themselves. Well, I said, Yale students think for themselves, but only because they know we want them to. I’ve had many wonderful students at Yale and Columbia, bright, thoughtful, creative kids whom it’s been a pleasure to talk with and learn from. But most of them have seemed content to color within the lines that their education had marked out for them. Only a small minority have seen their education as part of a larger intellectual journey, have approached the work of the mind with a pilgrim soul. These few have tended to feel like freaks, not least because they get so little support from the university itself. Places like Yale, as one of them put it to me, are not conducive to searchers. [explorers]  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Places like Yale are simply not set up to help students ask the big questions. I don’t think there ever was a golden age of intellectualism in the American university, but in the 19th century students might at least have had a chance to hear such questions raised in chapel or in the literary societies and debating clubs that flourished on campus. Throughout much of the 20th century, with the growth of the humanistic ideal in American colleges, students might have encountered the big questions in the classrooms of professors possessed of a strong sense of pedagogic mission. Teachers like that still exist in this country, but the increasingly dire exigencies of academic professionalization have made them all but extinct at elite universities. Professors at top research institutions are valued exclusively for the quality of their scholarly work; time spent on teaching is time lost. If students want a conversion experience, they’re better off at a liberal arts college.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When elite universities boast that they teach their students how to think, they mean that they teach them the analytic and rhetorical skills necessary for success in law or medicine or science or business. But a humanistic education is supposed to mean something more than that, as universities still dimly feel. So when students get to college, they hear a couple of speeches telling them to ask the big questions, and when they graduate, they hear a couple more speeches telling them to ask the big questions. And in between, they spend four years taking courses that train them to ask the little questions—specialized courses, taught by specialized professors, aimed at specialized students. Although the notion of breadth is implicit in the very idea of a liberal arts education, the admissions process increasingly selects for kids who have already begun to think of themselves in specialized terms—the junior journalist, the budding astronomer, the language prodigy. We are slouching, even at elite schools, toward a glorified form of vocational training.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Indeed, that seems to be exactly what those schools want. There’s a reason elite schools speak of training leaders, not thinkers—holders of power, not its critics. An independent mind is independent of all allegiances, and elite schools, which get a large percentage of their budget from alumni giving, are strongly invested in fostering institutional loyalty. As another friend, a third-generation Yalie, says, the purpose of Yale College is to manufacture Yale alumni. Of course, for the system to work, those alumni need money. At Yale, the long-term drift of students away from majors in the humanities and basic sciences toward more practical ones like computer science and economics has been abetted by administrative indifference. The college career office has little to say to students not interested in law, medicine, or business, and elite universities are not going to do anything to discourage the large percentage of their graduates who take their degrees to Wall Street. In fact, they’re showing them the way. The liberal arts university is becoming the corporate university, its center of gravity shifting to technical fields where scholarly expertise can be parlayed into lucrative business opportunities.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It’s no wonder that the few students who are passionate about ideas find themselves feeling isolated and confused. I was talking with one of them last year about his interest in the German Romantic idea of bildung, the upbuilding of the soul. But, he said—he was a senior at the time—it’s hard to build your soul when everyone around you is trying to sell theirs.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Yet there is a dimension of the intellectual life that lies above the passion for ideas, though so thoroughly has our culture been sanitized of it that it is hardly surprising if it was beyond the reach of even my most alert students. Since the idea of the intellectual emerged in the 18th century, it has had, at its core, a commitment to social transformation. Being an intellectual means thinking your way toward a vision of the good society and then trying to realize that vision by speaking truth to power. It means going into spiritual exile. It means foreswearing your allegiance, in lonely freedom, to God, to country, and to Yale. It takes more than just intellect; it takes imagination and courage. “I am not afraid to make a mistake,” Stephen Dedalus says, “even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake, and perhaps as long as eternity, too.”  
...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The world that produced John Kerry and George Bush is indeed giving us our next generation of leaders. The kid who’s loading up on AP courses junior year or editing three campus publications while double-majoring, the kid whom everyone wants at their college or law school but no one wants in their classroom, the kid who doesn’t have a minute to breathe, let alone think, will soon be running a corporation or an institution or a government. She will have many achievements but little experience, great success but no vision. The disadvantage of an elite education is that it’s given us the elite we have, and the elite we’re going to have."

"So there was a kid back in February from, ah, Baltimore--ah, 14 years old [Jack Andraka]--who, ah, had access to Jstor. And he'd been spelunking through Jstor after reading something, and he figured out a way to do early tests for pancreatic cancer [by infusing a conductive carbon mesh with a chemical that bonds to a biomarker from blood of a testee, thereby changing the conductivity of the material]. And pancreatic cancer kills the shit out of you because we detect it way too late: By the time we detect it, it's already too late to do anything about it. Ah, and, um, He sent emails off to the entire oncology department at Johns Hopkins, you know, hundreds of them .. and most of them ignored it, right. But one of them, like, sent him an email back and said 'This is not an entirely stupid idea. Why don't you come on over.' And this kid worked evenings and weekends with this researcher, and in February I heard him on the news, just a couple of weeks after Aaron died, when Aaron was in the news a lot. [*pauses and tears up*] Sorry [*breathes*] And, ah, he said, um, the reason he was on the news is cause they'd done it; they were shipping, ah, an early test for pancreatic cancer that was gonna save lives. And he said, ah, this is why what Aaron did was so important: Because you never know, right? This truth of the universe is not only something [*wipes tear*] that policy makers use to figure out, you know, what the speed limit should be; it's where the, the thing that's gonna keep, you know, your kid from dying of pancreatic cancer comes from. And, without access, the person who might come up with the thing that's got your number on it may never find that answer."

"Common sense tells us that consciously thinking about a problem or deliberating about the options is the best strategy for making a decision. Consider the possibility that *not* consciously thinking can produce an outcome superior to that of consciously thinking. In a study be Ap Dijksterhuis (2004), participants evaluated complex information regarding real-world choices. One situation involved selecting an apartment. In each case, the participants chose between alternatives that had negative features (e.g., high rent, bad location) and positive features (e.g., nice landlord, good view). Objectively, one apartment was the best choice. Some participants were required to make an immediate choice (no thought). Some had to think for 3 minutes and then choose (conscious thought). Others had to work for 3 minues on a difficult, distracting task and then choose (unconscious thought). Across three separate trials, those in the unconscious thought condition made the best decisions. According to Dijksterhuis and Nordgren (2006), unconscious processing is especially valuable for complex decisions in which it is difficult to weigh the pros and cons consciously. Perhaps this is why, for very important decisions, people often choose to "sleep on it.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Consider also the possibility that consciously thinking can undermine good decision making. The social psychologist Tim Wilson and the cognitive psychologist Jonathan Schooler (1991) asked research participants to rate james. When the participants simply tasted the james, their ratings were very similar to experts' ratings. However, whent he participants had to explain their ratings jam by jam, their ratings differed substantially from the experts'. Unless the experts were wrong, the participants had made poorer judgements: Having to reflect consciously about their reasons apparently altered their perceptions of the jams."

So for, you know, bears and chimpanzees and raccoons and birds and fish. How many kilocalories per kilometer did they spend to move? And, and humans were measured too. And, ah, the condor won; it was the most efficient. And mankind, the crown of creation, came in with a rather unimpressive showing about a third of the way down the list. Um, but somebody there had the brilliance to test a human riding a bicycle. *smiles* Blew away the condor--all the way off the charts! And I remember this really had an impact on me. I really remember this: that humans are tool-builders, and we build tools that can dramatically amplify our innate human abilities. And to me [the computer represents the ultimate tool.]--We actually ran an ad like this very early at Apple, that the personal computer was the bicycle of the mind.

"It must have been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were required to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6 p.m. curfew. I had gone to play with a Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others -- the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting."

"If man is to survive, he will have learned to take a delight in the essential differences between men and between cultures. He will learn that differences in ideas and attitudes are a delight, part of life's exciting variety, not something to fear."   
--Gene Roddenberry

"Star Trek was an attempt to say that humanity will reach maturity and wisdom on the day that it begins not just to tolerate, but take a special delight in differences in ideas and differences in life forms. […] If we cannot learn to actually enjoy those small differences, to take a positive delight in those small differences between our own kind, here on this planet, then we do not deserve to go out into space and meet the diversity that is almost certainly out there."  
--Gene Roddenberry

"It is the struggle itself that is most important. We must strive to be more than we are. It does not matter that we will not reach our ultimate goal. The effort itself yields its own reward."

"Reality is incredibly larger, infinitely more exciting, than the flesh and blood vehicle we travel in here. If you read science fiction, the more you read it the more you realize that you and the universe are part of the same thing. Science knows still practically nothing about the real nature of matter, energy, dimension, or time; and even less about those remarkable things called life and thought. But whatever the meaning and purpose of this universe, you are a legitimate part of it. And since you are part of the all that is, part of its purpose, there is more to you than just this brief speck of existence. You are just a visitor here in this time and this place, a traveler through it."

I end the program by saying 'You've made this day a special day by just your being you. There's no person in the whole world like you, and I like you just the way you are.' And I feel that if we in public television can only make it clear that feelings are mentionable and manageable, we will have done a great service."

"In one particularly telling real-world example from 2016 of how such cuts affected students in the “brick and mortar” district, high school junior Jameria Miller talks about why she starts every morning running through the school to get a good seat near the front of the room in her first-period Spanish class. It’s not because she is just excited about the class. It’s because the school is cold. As she explains, “The cold is definitely a distraction. We race to class to get the best blankets.” What she means is that because the classroom where she begins her day has uninsulated metal walls, Jameria’s teacher hands out blankets to the students on a first come, first served basis. It’s the only way for them to stay warm. Miller’s school in the William Penn District is situated in Philadelphia’s “inner-ring” suburbs and serves a student body that is majority Black and overwhelmingly impoverished. Though concentrating in the cold is hard enough, Miller says the hardest part of her daily ordeal is the knowledge that life isn’t like this for students in other districts. She means students in wealthier districts. “It’s never going to be fair, they’re always going to be a step ahead of us. They’ll have more money than us, and they’ll get better jobs than us, always.” She says she doesn’t believe that either funding or systemic school improvement will ever truly equalize: “What I’m about to say might not be very nice, but rich people aren’t going to want [funding fairness]. They want their kids to have better things so that their kids can get a jump start in life and be ahead of everyone else. And, as long as people feel that way, we all won’t be equal. We won’t receive equal education ever, because education is what gets you success.”"

“From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here, that's home, that's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar", every "supreme leader", every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there----on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conciets than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”   
--Carl Sagan

"Those worlds in space are as countless as all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the earth. Each  of those worlds is as real as ours. In every one of them there’s a succession of incidents, events, occurrences which influence its future. Countless worlds, numberless moments, an immensity of space and time. And our small planet at this moment: here we face a critical branch point in history. What we do with our world right now will propagate down through the centuries and powerfully affect the destiny of our descendents. It is well within our power to destroy our civilization and perhaps our species as well. If we capitulate to superstition or greed or stupidity, we could plunge our world into a darkness deeper than the time between the collapse of classical civilization and the Italian  Renaissance. But we’re also capable of using our compassion and our intelligence, our technology and our wealth, to make an abundant and meaningful life for every inhabitant of this planet, to enhance  enormously our understanding of the universe and to carry us to the stars."

"... someone able to speak the truth, a ... courageous and angry individual for whom no worldly power is too big and imposing to be criticised and pointedly taken to task.

"Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that 'computer science' is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we thing. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called *procedural epistemology*--the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of 'what is'. Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of 'how to'."

"I hesitate to give advice because every major single piece of advice I was given turned out to be wrong and I am glad I didn’t follow them. I was told to focus and I never did. I was told to never procrastinate and I waited 20 years for the Black Swan and it sold 3 million copies. I was told to avoid putting fictional characters in my books and I did put in Nero Tulip and Fat Tony because I got bored otherwise. I was told to not insult the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, the more I insulted them the nicer they were to me and solicit Op-Eds. I was told to avoid lifting weights for a back pain and became a weightlifter: never had a back problem since.
