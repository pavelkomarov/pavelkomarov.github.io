These three belong to us, Pavel and Nataly, @ 629 12<sup>th</sup> Ave E Apt A, 941-545-7573. Before here, Pavel lived for three years in Salt Lake City without a yard, so he toilet trained his two cats. We are currently working on the little one. They're all gentle and lovely.

##### Born
April 28<sup>th</sup> 2020, Mount Pleasant UT, to domestic cats kept by farmers

##### Personality
I’m the most handsome, king of the yard, and I’m confident about it. I’m plush, unassuming, peace-loving, and very physically talented. I’m shy but actually very interested in you. My favorite things are lounging in the grass, catching birds or rats to the chagrin of my people, fishing discarded lint roller tape from the garbage, and getting my butt rapidly lightly smacked and scratched. I was hit by a car crossing 12<sup>th</sup> the night of Sept 30<sup>th</sup>/Oct 1<sup>st</sup> 2025 and got a tail pull injury that paralyzed my tail, bladder, and anus. Thankfully my ability to pee and poop on my own later returned, but my tail is still not completely the same, so be gentle with my lower back for a while. When traveling I need to hunker in the back and not be disturbed. I don’t like being held in one place for more than a few seconds, even by people I trust, but do like getting petted and brushed, some times like being carried elsewhere, and might perch on your chest if you’re lying down. I jump away from Pumpkin and Miso when they're' being annoying, although I know I could beat them up easily and like playing with the kitten sometimes. I run and hide from other animals until I get to know them. I’m egalitarian and forgiving. I’m reserved unless I’m on my own turf and feeling really relaxed. I'm quiet, but I do chatter and chirp when excited.

##### Born
May 5<sup>th</sup> 2020, Pocatello ID, to a stray mother caught by volunteer

##### Personality
I’m the most beautiful, and I know it. I’m fluffy, talkative, pompous, and kinda derpy at jumping and balancing. I’m fairly bold but like to act aloof. My favorite things are food, lying that I haven't had dinner yet, going behind the refrigerator and pretending that I need help, and trying to sneak in to neighbor's houses. I once climbed a tree trying to reach a fledgling crow and stumbled multiple times on my way down. Another time I tried to jump on top of the fence, didn't quite make it, and slid back down. When traveling I need to be in the driver’s lap and occasionally look out a window. I ragdoll a little when held, like belly rubs, and might jump in your lap or climb the back of your chair if I like you enough. I like to start play fights with Fozzy and chase Pavel’s feet around the house, but when Miso pulls the same shenanigans with me, it gets on my nerves. I stand my ground with other animals and act tough, but I don’t really want to fight. I keep score of who’s nice to me and play favorites. I understand human socialization pretty well and will make a lot of eye contact with and meow at you, especially if you pay attention to and talk to me.

# Miso

##### Born
28<sup>th</sup> May 2025, Orting WA, to pet cats belonging to a woman who mistakenly called him "pretty girl"

##### Personality
I'm the baby and the most spoiled. I'm a bit shy around strangers, but I'm very friendly once I get to know you which doesn't take very long. I like to do everything with my family, including watching them shower, helping them cook, and snuggling under the covers at bed time. I enjoy jumping on my brothers, and attacking everyones hands because it's always play time.  I'm obsessed with foliage, and bring leaves in the house to play with on a regular basis. Aside from leaves, my favorite toy is a 2 legged unicorn llama. I'm the most adventurous, and like to go on hikes and bike rides in my back pack. Sometimes I will even walk on the leash when I am feeling brave. I never hiss at other cats, but I do hiss at dogs. I like to steal the treat bag and rip it open.
