# Pavel's Site


## Getting started on a new machine

1. `sudo apt install ruby`
2. Installing gems doesn't work due to environment variables?  
  ```bash
  echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
  echo 'export GEM_HOME=$HOME/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
  echo 'export PATH=$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```
  Still doesn't work due to build errors? `sudo apt install ruby-dev`  
  Still doesn't work? `sudo apt install g++`  
  `gem` is a package manager much like `pip`. They're going to tell you to use `bundler`, but I honestly think it's more confusion than it's worth. It's hung on me before with no good explanation.
3. `gem install github-pages` should pull down and install basically everything gh-pages uses to render stuff, including `jekyll` and `jekyll-remote-theme`
4. Pay attention to where the gems were installed, and make a symlink with `ln -s /var/..path/jekyll /usr/bin/jekyll` so you can just call `jekyll` from command line.
5. `jekyll serve` from the site's root directory, and visit it at `localhost:4000` in a browser.


## How Jekyll works

## How Github Pages works

1. Continuous integration listens for a push and, when one is recieved, if there is a `_config.yml` file, Jekyll is called. For Project Pages, this occurs on the `gh-pages` branch. User Pages are confusingly a special case where this occurs on the master branch.
2. Any remote themes are fetched, and Jekyll runs through its [order of operations](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/hyde#order-of-operations-for-jekyll) to produce static site output. There are so many gotchas in here that it's crazy, so I've started [writing down the most infuriating ones](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/pavel-theme#important-notes)


## Structure
- `_config.yaml` contains basic Jekyll configuration.
- `_writing/` is a collections of not-repo-associated articles I've put together
- `CNAME` (short for "custom domain name") is necessary so github's servers know where to forward queries.
